Thank you for providing great customer service!
Fast shipping! Communication with seller is great.
Great customer service with questions and edits!
Fast communication and delivery , thank you!
Seller response is fast, appreciate the fast shipping for the holidays
Excited for our family to wear these shirts on our vacation.
Seller response is fast and very helpful!
Seller response is fast and very helpful!
Family loved the gift! They will wear the shirts for their vacation!
Love this tee.  Perfect.
LOVE this shirt!  My sentiments exactly!   Good to be able to show my side of the issues with a shirt like this.  Thank you!
Love this shirt!  It is well made and fits perfectly.   And the message is important!
This shirt is a little stiffer than I would like.  But, the print quality is great!
Good quality sweatshirt and excellent embroidery!
Seller communication was outstanding!
It's going in my teenage daughter's Easter basket.  She is going to LOVE it!
Beautifully made and will definitely buy again!
Sweatshirt was phenomenal!! Beautifully done and very high quality. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it arrived weeks late, but it was also around the holidays.
Great quality item! Looks just like my boy :)
Beautiful item, really great communication
Beautiful sweatshirt exactly as described!
Took wayyy longer to get than expected, but they answered my questions quickly and the end product was absolutely amazing!
Beautiful embroidery and good quality
High quality! Very beautiful piece to wear to show off my recently deceased pet as well as his older pet brother…. Super happy with this purchase.
The quality is great and soft. The embroidery looks exactly like my pup. I can’t wait to gift this sweater! I love it so much I ordered another one. 
However beware of Shipping considering I got it almost a month after it said I would. Customer service was very friendly and responded promptly.
it was perfect… my little sister absolutely loves it
Really greatly quality, very long shipping but the person worked with sending me another item and was very helpful and they were kind.
It was perfect. But it just took long to get due to the holidays and the seller being backed up on orders. But i love my sweatshirt in memory of my fur baby.
I’ve ordered 2 shirts since I fell in love with the first. My first experience working with them was great. Regular check-ins and confirmation before moving forward. 
The second shirt, I didn’t get a photo when the embroider was done, it was just shipped. 
Thankfully my mom loved the shirt, but I would have liked to see it first. 
In any case, would recommend.
Great response and fast turnaround time.
Amazing product and my partner loves it!
Very high quality sweatshirt with a beautiful design, made for a great gift!
Beautiful Product, My boyfriend absolutely loves it! Shipping took a little while but i ordered 5 days before christmas so it was perfectly reasonable. The seller was so helpful and responsive, i highly recommend!
My aunt has a pup she absolutely adores so it was a no brainer to get her one of these sweatshirts for her birthday. I ordered it a little late and the delivery window was supposed to be right after her birthday. Not only did the sweatshirt show up on her actual birthday, but it was absolutely stunning! The material is soft and comfy, the embroidery is exactly like the proof, and interacting with the seller was so efficient and friendly. I also got myself a matching sweatshirt with both of my pups and it’s perfect! Again, exactly like the proofs, high quality, and I’ve gotten TONS of compliments! I can’t say enough great things about this item and the shop, I’ll definitely be ordering more in the future!
Oh my gosh, this is the best gift I have ever given to someone. It is of my boyfriend's deceased cat and I had no clear images of him. The seller was so kind and drew up a sketch based off of multiple blurry photos and sent the mock design over and I was so happy. I recieved the product, and it is sooo beautiful. My boyfriend loves it so much. We also got a little teddy bear with our order, and it felt like a little gift from my bf's old kitty. 10/10 would recommend the shop and the product!!
Beautiful work!  Looks like my dogs!
Good quality but took a long time to receive. Understandable with the type of product but allow for at least 2 months
Great item!! Very happy with my t-shirt which is very realistic and which was delivered very quickly! I am very happy and I recommend without hesitation :)
The hoodies turned out great again. Thank you very much.
The quality is very nice, image looks great on the shirt, but shipping took a while.
This sweatshirt turned out amazing!! I would definitely order well in advance because it took about two months to arrive but it was well worth the wait.
Absolutely beautiful item, but as noted in other reviews, definitely order well before you actually need it. It took a very long time to arrive. But it is gorgeous and well worth the wait. Thank you.
I love my sweatshirt! My pup just passed away so it’s a perfect way to honor my pup!
This was a present for my mom because  she lost her 2 furbabies at the same time. So I wanted to find a way to eternalize them and this seller did just that! I am SO HAPPY with the stitch work and everything. It is perfect!!
I bought two of these sweaters and absolutely love them. Very good detail and the seller is really good about responding to any questions. They arrived early too!
Amazing gift! I am sure the recipient will love it. Seller super helpful
perfect present for animal lovers
So lovely to see the product you've ordered and thought about exactly like you imagined. Thank you!
The owner was extremely helpful and always replied. There was an issue with my order and they replaced it and made me a whole new jumper for free. Yes delivery takes a while but it is worth the wait. Very happy with the end result
Nice looking gift! Only issue was that it took 2 mos. to arrive at the recipient’s home.
Super job making a great sweatshirt with three Shetland sheepdogs.  One shipped, it arrived in NJ in about a week.
quality is great, looks just like my pup
The item quality is amazing and definitely worth the money
Very good quality and nice to wear. Took a while to get to NL (2 months) but worth the wait
I loved my custom sweater so much! I was surprised how great it turned out. Highly recommend! Thank you!
Great quality and amazing design. I love how customizable it is. Seller was communicative and nice. The amount of time between me placing the order and my friend receiving the sweatshirt was about 10 weeks. Definitely felt like a long time but general timeline was what I expected. Definitely would order again!
Great gift for my friend!
great quality but shipping took very long and over the time it send it would take. i would recommend but just know it could take several months to get your order.
I'm thrilled with the product. The picture of my dog turned out beautifully, and I would order it again. I'm deducting one point because the delivery time was long. Nevertheless, I'm happy to order it again and again, and I've already recommended it to others.
I liked how the embroidered pets came out. I order 2 large sweatshirts and I’m usually a medium. 
For the amount of money that I paid for these, I’m quite disappointed with the quality of the sweater. It’s very stiff, and scratchy. Also feels like it fits small for a large, maybe just the stiffness. 
I’ve already washed it a few times to see if it would help but it doesn’t unfortunately. Not able to wear it honestly. Might have to cut out the embroidery and sew it onto a different sweatshirt? Which is frustrating for the price I paid. 
Took two months but this was the expected delivery date. Seller responded to my questions in a timely manner.
The sweater took a while to get here but the seller was really communicative. After providing an initial design, they took my feedback and made updates. Really happy with the final product!
It turned out even better than I imagined. I got the mock up before and loved it, but it literally exceeded my expectations. Thank you so much for this sentimental keepsake.
Turned out great! However, I ordered it in December 2024 and finally received it in mid Feb 2025. I was led to believe that the design and completion of the sweatshirt would only take 2 weeks. The design itself didn't even get completed until 1/16/25 and it wasn't shipped until 2/12.
Best gifts for dog moms!
The quality is amazing, even better than I thought it would be! The embroidery looks exactly like the pet, even down to the wrinkle lines. I got this as a gift and my father loves it!
I bought a sweatshirt with three dogs for a friend. The embroidery looked just like the pictures! 10/10 recommend.
Great purchase! Pictures matched pictures perfectly!
This embroidered sweatshirt was very well crafted and exactly what I wanted to gift to someone special. Thank you!
I absolutely love it so much!!!
The product is FANTASTIC. The shipping? I ordered it Dec 10th and received it almost 3 months later. Customer service? I mean, it worked out, but the messages very much were templates. Listen, again, FANTASTIC product. But be ready for the rest.
loved it! was exactly what i was hoping for
Amazing quality and super accurate. The seller also responded very quickly and great communication!
The embroidery on the sweater is spectacular and my mom loved it! Worth waiting the distance to the USA!
Embroidery was amazing! Looked exactly like the picture
item looks really nice and of good quality.
The quality of the item
lovely quality hoody and thrilled with the embroidery of my dog, shall wear with much pride and joy thankyou
Really super nice gift and great workmanship
Impeccable. As described.
Again great work and a really nice result.
The product itself is pretty good. Not as soft as expected. But overall good quality. The production and shipping was terrible. It looks about 2 months to get. The seller just told me they were backed up. Offered a gift but it was just a tiny stuffed animal, half the size of my hand. A discount for the delay would have been better.
Took over 2 months to get, way longer than the estimated date. Would not recommend if you need by a certain time. Other than that the product is nice, sweatshirt is comfortable but not very soft.
The item was ordered on the 10th of December and only arrived mid February despite the original expected date to be between early-mid Jan and very early Feb. Original correspondence with sending over photo etc was very good with swift response time, however no correspondence was received regarding the delay until I chased up the seller, who the made the excuse of Christmas overflow delaying delivery. When asked for a new expected delivery date was told that she didn't know as it was a custom item and some generic responses were received until further prompted.  
The item was fine and quality was good once it arrived, but delivery took a disappointingly long time as was the lack of correspondence re same.
Although the sweater was beautiful and turned out great, the service and delivery were TERRIBLE. I was supposed to get this in early January as a late Christmas gift for my mom, and ended up receiving it almost two months later, with the excuse that the seller had too much accumulated work from the holidays.
I believe that, if you have work backed up from too many orders, the right thing to do is to stop sales, to prevent things like this from happening. 
That not being enough, I continually asked the seller to please update me on my order as for some reason I stopped getting Etsy notifications, and she continually gave me excuses, not wanting to give me more information.
Overall, the customer service was mediocre, and if I had known it would’ve taken two extra months to get to me, I would’ve bought elsewhere. Wouldn’t recommend
I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she is absolutely tickled with it - it feels like a quality sweatshirt, the representation of her cat Pickles is spot on and oh so cute.  Communication with the seller was good and she responded promptly when I had concerns with how long it was taking.  I ordered Jan 16, and received today, Mar 4th.  If you have concerns, reach out.  Seller will respond.  My daughter loves her new sweatshirt!
Very good quality and they do great with the design!
The sweatshirt came out beautifully! The coloring of the dogs was perfect!
Amazing amazing gift :) couldn't ask better
Product is great! Only issue was with holiday shipping and it being delayed by approximately two months.
Exactly as pictured. Made a great gift for our friends who are obsessed with their dog. Shipping to US took a bit as expected, but estimated timeline was off.
Although my item took a lot longer than expected to ship, care, diligence and craftsmanship were all portrayed and worth the wait.
It has taken me a while to review this sweatshirt, but honestly it was one of the best gifts i’ve ever gotten for my sister. It did take a two months to get here, I live in the US and but they were very responsive in giving me options and very helpful! I also ordered around Christmas and these definitely take time to do, I would definitely purchase something again!
Item was great.  Delivery was at least 1 month after expected arrival date and seller couldn’t  accurately predict arrival time.
This was a gift for my mom and was received very well <3 thank you so much!
The quality of the hoodie is great and the embroidery craftsmanship is amazing! The only downside was the item did not arrive on time but it was definitely worth the wait! I also liked how the seller responded to my questions and concerns in a timely manner. Overall very happy with my purchase. 😊
I love my sweaters!! The quality is great and the designs of my pets are perfect. The designer was also really easy to get ahold of and communicative. I fully recommend these and recommend ordering way ahead of time if you’re ordering for Christmas :)
Absolutely adorable hoodie. They were very kind through message and were very diligent in making sure the design was what you wanted.
They did an excellent job making the dogs into stitches!
Very patient when it came to ensuring my babies looked exactly like their photos! Shipping took a bit longer but well worth it! I will more than likely order another!!!
The sweatshirt took a long time to get here, but when it arrived I loved how it looked!
Beautiful sweatshirt and great customer service. The seller was so responsive and let me know updates on the order. It was a gift and my friend loves it!
It was gorgeous, well worth the wait and money. Quality material too. Seller accomodated a revision to the design, great customer service.
The item was exactly how I pictured in my mind hoping it to be. It was a gift to my sister and her dog means the world to her and she loved it. She said the extra details made it even more special.
It’s perfect! Item is of high quality and seller did an amazing job I love it. My dog looks super handsome in this sweater cannot wait to wear it!
A great product and the saleswoman was very helpful and committed
A great product and the saleswoman was very helpful and committed.
The quality of the fabric and embroidery was definitely satisfactory, the shipping however took MONTHS. I ordered this product on December 1st and didn’t receive until early March with minimal updates that entire time. The seller would reply when I reached out usually within 24-36 hours though. The size however is why it’s not 5 stars. I had seen another review showing that the sizes are not true and that they’re all large. I had hoped otherwise but when i finally received my product the “medium” was most definitely NOT medium.
Sweater is fine but it arrived over a month past the expected date and I ordered it 1 1/2 months in advance of that date
Beautiful and exactly as described! Shipping took a while longer than stated but worth it.
Took 2.5 months to arrive
High quality sweatshirt with detailed embroidery. The seller was responsive and helpful while designing the graphic. Took longer to receive than expected, but understandable for the quality and amount of orders she receives. Made for a great gift and I couldn’t be more happy with the product!
Review update— they reached out and gave me a discount for my next order because of the longer shipping. I’ll be ordering again. 
The shirt is perfect however, it took almost 3 months to get here. So just beware of long shipping time
Beautiful workmanship, just arrived later than expected
We ordered two sweatshirts that both came out amazing; however, it took over two months to receive them. The seller was courteous enough to provide updates when available, but when the items were supposed to be Christmas gifts and ordered at the beginning of December, it can be frustrating. As long as you keep in mind that your items might be delivered later (a lot later) than expected, then you should be fine and will be happy with the quality of the clothing.
The sweatshirt is adorable, and very close to the reference photo I sent. It did take almost 2 months to come due an influx in orders, but the seller was very responsive and kept me in the loop on production and shipping information.
Was a great gift for someone who loves their dog
Highly recommended! They are very good with communication and the quality of the sweater is actually very good.
The item had the same quality that was advertised in the listing. I would recommend purchasing this item for yourself or as a gift.
Shipping took a while, but overall great gift!
This sweater means more than you know. I bought this sweater for my fiancée for a Christmas gift. Unfortunately we lost our dog did not make it to Christmas. When this finally came it felt like a piece of him. The seller worked with me every. freaking. step. of the way. I will admit I was picky but I wanted this to be perfect since we lost Chino. She was so kind and helpful and gave good advice as well. She shows you the draft and listens to your feedback. She will even show you the final product. This is definitely worth every penny.
Took a while to arrive, but seller was communicating the whole time. SO happy I waited for it, I’m in love!!!
Great quality and my mom loved her gift!
Beautifully done! I got this as a gift, and now I want one for myself! Would definitely recommend:)
It was for a gift, she loved it! She is wearing it all the time, says it's cozy and she loves the embroidery reproduction of her dogs
Customer service 10/10, for every question I had a quick response, well embroidered images, the craftswoman even made an exception for images of rats instead of cats or dogs.
Truly save your money!! don’t buy from this place unless you want to receive your item 3 months later with poor communication and it’s just genuinely not that worth it
While my husband likes his shirt and it is nice, I ordered in November with an expected delivery date of December 15th, but it did not show up till January. I did ask for order updates and was told they had high volume of orders and were working on it, but I you are getting that many orders I don’t know why they didn’t update/change expected delivery dates.
The name was not centered under the pet face, but the pet face was nice. I also got false shipping notices and the item took much longer than promised… the shop did update me when I reached out.
I ordered this item at the end of November as a Christmas present. Of course I did not expect it to come in by Christmas, as this is an extremely busy time. I got an estimated date for about 2 weeks after Christmas, which I was fine with, and even then, I expected it might be a little late. I just received it about 5 days ago (2/17/25). Over a month late! While I understand delays due to the holidays, the seller should be a little more forthcoming about when to actually expect the product. The sweatshirt itself came out great and my friend absolutely loves it! I just wish there was a little more transparency with the time frame. Don’t expect to receive your item on time, but the item you order will come out amazing!
Product is very cute and well made but shipping took much longer than stated.
I purchased an embroidered t-shirt on Dec 16, knowing the item will be received late in Jan. However, by mid-Jan I've received no update whatsoever from the seller. The constant back and forth of me having to reach out in order for them to respond just made me more disappointed in the seller. I finally received my item, and at this point, the excitement for the shirt is just out the window. Although the shirt and quality is nice, it was not worth the wait. Needless to say, I will never shop from this seller again. My recommendation for future shoppers and anyone who reads my review: buy from somewhere else.
This sweater was a huge hit for my sister. Her cats are her world so she felt especially loved receiving this gift. I was disappointed with the wait time. I ordered it early December and had an estimated arrival date of early January. As January rolled around I reached out to the seller because I had yet to have heard from them about a proof. I was then informed it would be February or March before I received my item due to the holidays. I understand but wish I had known this before ordering. I was offered a refund and apologies but I had already decided to share with my sister what her gift was since it would arrive after Christmas so I went ahead with the order. It arrived in February and she loves it.
Seller was very responsive to messages about the order. The sweatshirt material is very high quality and the embroidery is so detailed, it looks exactly like my dog!
I was very pleased with this product!
It definitely went over my expectations! The owner was always willing to correspond and the item was exactly what I requested.
It was a great product
Seller was very communicative and helpful throughout the process. Girlfriend loved the sweater!!
My friend loved her shirt! Amazing work
Amazing and so cute! It was a gift but I want one for myself now lol
The sweatshirt if a nice quality shirt.  The color looks exactly as shown on the site, and the embroidery is excellent.  The picture of the gift recipient's dog really matches the shirt.  I appreciated Mervat sending a rendering as promised, before the shirt was made. The only bad part of this experience was the shipping time.  Two months is just too long to have to wait for an item.  This Christmas gift wasn't able to be given until early February.  If you don't mind a long wait, the item turned out very nice.
Sweatshirt embroidery was well done and quite similar to the photo I submitted, however the shipping process was not great - I ordered on Dec 8 and didn't receive the product till  Feb 5 (which was significantly past the estimated shipping date). It's a cute gift, but budget yourself A LOT of time. I had to keep reaching out to ask for status updates and information wasn't super forthcoming.
The quality of the sweater is not the best (what I already expected for this price), BUT the quality of the embroiling is outstanding.

The sweatshirt looks wonderful and will make the perfect gift! The likeness of Jack the dog is spot on!!
It met my expectations of the item, the person who received the gift loved it! Customers service was amazing.
I love it! I love it!!!!
Beautiful design and well made 🫶
Obsessed with the artwork!! Recommend to many!
Very nice quality and helpful customer service :)
Such wonderful clothing and craftsmanship!! Although came late, the customer service was excellent and very helpful//cooperative. Thank you!!
It turned out so great and met any/all expectations and then some:) thank you for the great gift
My order didn't arrive on time. I would like to be notified if it was running late.
It is more beautiful than expected!
Item matching the description
Cute and good quality picture was ok
JOKE OF A SHOP! ZERO STARS!
Apparently they are 3 months behind on orders- delivery time is wildly off and a blatant lie. This was a customized gift that is now unacceptably late and the only help offered was to "wait a little while longer." NO communication- they never would have told me about the delay if I didn't reach out first. DO NOT USE THIS PIECE OF TRASH SHOP.
Xx xxxx xxxx. Xxxx xxxx
Very high quality and well designed. Love it
Got this for a friend after her beloved dog passed away. Store owner was very friendly and transparent with me about being backed up during the busy season. Well worth the wait, my friend was in love and so thankful!
High quality gift that I would def recommend to my friends and family
This sweater was the perfect gift.
The item came long after estimated arrival time, but the seller was very good at communication, and told me they were backed up because of the holidays. For the inconvenience, they put an extra gift item in the shipment. I received a coupon too. The rendering they made of the photo I sent them was just superb! It looked great embroided on fabric too! Just a good vibes seller who cares about their customers. Great service! Thank you❤️ The sweater made my girlfriend so happy that she cried!❤️
Very happy with the quality and design was just what I wanted. Seller contacted me several times to approve the design and make sure everything was like I wanted. Definitely will order from them again.
Very slow to ship & I had to reach out for an update on the order. The actual sweatshirt is a bit scratchy & not insulated well.
I love this sweater! I ordered it in November and it didn’t get here till January, but the seller was very polite and professional - she let me know that there was a holiday backlog and she could get to it as soon as possible. When it came, I was so glad and it was worth the wait! She also sent an extra small gift. Very happy with the purchase and appreciated her being honest with me about my order!
I loved this shirt. It was a Christmas present for my sister. She loved it! And the customer service was spectacular!
Love the item, it made a perfect gift. Only disappointment was it arrived about 3 weeks later than I was told it would, so if you are thinking of ordering as a Christmas gift order it at least 2-3 months in advance.
wouldn't change a thing about it. partner loves it.
They answer fast when you have questions and are really friendly! I received it within 2 months and it was absolutely perfect 😁
Great quality and the seller worked with me to meet the vision I had planned!! They were very helpful and the sweater turned out adorable!!
The merchant responded in good time to all of my many questions.
My wife really loves this sweatshirt.  It took much longer than expected to arrive.   Very like-like quality to our dog and the material is really nice.
Asked for a rendition before the embroidery took place so that I could approve it. Seller quickly adjusted what I wanted changed and I’m very happy with the sweatshirt quality as well as the rendition of the photo I submitted
Sweater took awhile to come but i did order over the holidays, sweater looks exactly how i wanted it to! Customer service was great and always responsive.
It matches the description, although the quality of the sweatshirt is thin, and the sleeves are short. But the design is a 10!
It was a gift, she was very happy.
I placed an order last month and expected it to be shipped by now. Unfortunately, the vendor did not communicate any delays until I reached out for an update. When I followed up, I received a vague and unconvincing excuse. I am disappointed with the lack of proactive communication and accountability.
Came 3 months later. I did have to reach out first to figure out what was happening with my order. I expected higher quality but the dog is spot on. I wouldn’t order from them again.
Product is nice. Took 4 months to ship with no communication from vendor. Had to reach out my self when our items weren’t even shipped  when they were supposed to have arrived.
After reviewing Etsy endlessly for a Christmas gift for dog people, I found this option and it was seemingly perfect. I ordered this item on Dec. 5th, 2024 and did not receive until Feb. 4th, 2025. It took two months for this item to arrive to me. I contacted the seller and she was helpful in providing updates when asked, but I often was the one who reached out first wondering where my item was. I realized that I ordered during the holiday rush, and knew my order would arrive after Christmas, but two months is excessive. The material is slightly scratchy, but the embroidery is cute.
Absolutely lovely. Looks good 👍🏻
The item took awhile to arrive, but contact with the seller about its arrival time was quick and concise. I am pleased with the quality of the sweater and embroidery. I recommend purchasing early on if you are planning to buy as a gift as the seller was inundated with orders during the holidays.
She was extremely helpful answering any questions I had regarding customization and the sweatshirt is adorable!
High quality. Great customer service.
Item was as described, the final product came out great but shipping took wayyy longer than expected
Item was awesome quality and beautiful art! Met my expectations.
Great product with quality materials!
This is a great gift for any pet owner.  The image is reviewed beforehand so you don't have to wonder how it will turn out.  Everyone has complimented me on my sweater when I wear it.  Thank you!

Took longer to make but was cute
Item was as described and captured my pets likeness so well! Shipping took a little longer than excepted (international so added delays) but it was well worth the wait!
Amazing quality and attention to detail! Even though there were delays in the arrival time the seller was fantastic with communication and made the process extremely simple. This was a gift and they loved it so much so there were happy tears so it was well worth the wait!
This sweatshirt is absolutely gorgeous and I’m so excited to give it to my MIL! It’s high quality and the design looks just like her dog! The only downside was shipping time. I ordered around Thanksgiving and didn’t receive it until the end of January… communication was ok, but there were long swaths of time where I wasn’t sure what was going on, and the package was weirdly hard to track. 
However, over all, it’s a great item if you’re willing to wait!
My sister loved this sweatshirt that I gifted to her. It is a unique gift that’s perfect for any pet lover. It did take quite a while to ship, however, it was worth the wait. The seller also communicated frequently with me.
Loved our sweatshirt with our dog 's face embroidered on it!
This shop is AMAZING. I cannot recommend it enough. The sweatshirt was above and beyond my expectations and for such a reasonable price. The seller contacted me with a mockup of the embroidery and altered it perfectly to my requests. If you’re looking for a personalized animal sweatshirt, this is 100% the shop to buy from! Thank you so much!!
This was a great Christmas gift!
She was so helpful with this. I didn't have any good pictures of my SIL's dog but she said she could work with what I had. I asked before ordering. The day I went to order I was able to get a good photo and she captured him perfectly even the little tongue hanging out! She was super sweet and sent a little bear keychain too which my SIL will love!
The design came out great, very pleased!
Everything was great and the t-shirt looks great, thank you for that
quality of item was good. it did shrink a little. seller had very poor communication. order arrived several weeks past the estimated arrival date with no update from the seller. i had to message multiple times to receive any update. would recommend the item but buy well before the desired arrival date.
I’m honestly incredibly disappointed with this purchase mainly because of the customer service and shipping speed. I placed this order on November 26th and I chose this shop because of the many positive reviews and the shipping speed said that it would arrive between dec 28 and Jan 1, while a little after Christmas, I was okay with this. By December 10th I had not received a rendering yet and reached out to the seller i was told the rendering was not yet completed. I asked when I would receive it and got no answer on a timeline. I did not get the rendering of my image until December 22nd. Nearly a month after my order was placed. My package did not arrive until January 27th and I was provided with NO tracking information. 
The sweatshirt itself other than the embroidery is very sub par quality. Ratios very off, placement poor.
Ordered it in early November as a Christmas gift and didn't get it until late January, communication between the seller was not great and overall the material of the sweatshirt isn't even that great for the price
Disappointed.. Delivered 1 month late... The result is nice but the trace of the circle stands out, which is not clean at all.
Shipping was a little slower than expected, but the product was great!
It came out beautifully. My friend loved it. It looked just like her dog.
even better than i expected, definitely recommend! will probably buy more in the future
I love it so much! This is the second time I've ordered one of their dog sweaters and the quality is always amazing and captures the personalities of the dogs perfectly!
Seller was super patient with changes to design & it came out looking perfect!!! Sweatshirt is also super cozy and looks to be a piece that will hold up for a long time. Thank you!!!!!!
Said “order after this date and it wont be guaranteed to come before Christmas”, I ordered way before the date and it still didn’t come still the first week of January. Aside from that everything was perfect.
Love it so much! Great quality!
Loved it!! So cute and cozy, and customer service was very friendly and helpful!
My mom absolutely loved this gift!! I would buy again, however shipping was a little confusing as I bought it in November and was told it would arrive in December and it finally arrived at the end of January. The product is amazing quality though and the seller was very accommodating!!!
The quality of this item was great. The photos and the finished product were a great match and it really looked just like the photo. The quality of the sweatshirt and the stitching is really great. The reason for four stars as many others mention is how late it arrived. I ordered it on November 27 and it didn’t arrive until January 23. My shipping estimate when I ordered said December 20 through January 4. So it was an entire month late and it was supposed to be a Christmas gift. The product is great if you have at least an extra month or so to order it, knowing it will take a long time to arrive.
The seller was so amazing and kind! She captured the beauty of my cat so well. I love my new sweater. The price is so much better compared to bigger shops which charge more. You can definitely tell the seller cares. So 10/10 would recommend.
Good quality 👌 helpful service
So cute!!!!! I love it...
good quality and matched the description. Great communication through the design process.
Super cute! Seller is very detailed!
Awesome product. Would order again
Super high quality and got my dogs image perfect we loved it
Perfect but too expensive: the same product is available 3x cheaper on Etsy!
Great product and friendly saleswoman, responsive to answer questions
Perfect !
Never received item. Was scammed.
It is so sad that my review is highly brought down because of the shipping time. The item quality was great, but it took FAR longer than expected. It was wayyy longer than the expected delivery date, and the seller was not helpful in making the situation okay. They did not update me that it would not arrive on time, and didn’t offer any kind of refund for it being way delayed. I would not order again at this point.
i bought from this shop and another shop. the other shop was cheaper, more detailed, better fabric, and shipped faster. this listing showed that if i ordered before x date i would get my order before christmas. i ordered before then and it didn’t come until january 15th. i wasn’t able to gift it for christmas. they honestly shouldn’t advertise fulfillment by christmas if they aren’t able to. the actual product itself was decent, but like i said there are better shops out there
Overall, I had a horrible experience with this seller. It took a month for my item to get to me and the whole time, when I would ask for updates or a time frame on when the item would get shipped, I would never get an answer. Once the item got to me, I opened up the package and noticed there was a rip in the seam (both on the front and back). This was a gift for one of my friends and wasn’t going to give it to her like that, so on top of what I paid, I had to pay a tailor to get the seam fixed.
Disappointed with Long Wait Times
I ordered an item on December 8th, and I have to say, my experience has been quite disappointing. After patiently waiting for over a month with no update, I was informed that my order won't be ready until March. This is incredibly frustrating, especially since I had high hopes based on the initial promise of timely delivery.
I took the time to read through other reviews and noticed that some customers have faced similar issues, which makes me wonder if there’s a systemic problem with order fulfillment. While I understand that delays can happen, a wait of several months feels excessive and unreasonable.
I genuinely wanted to love this product and support the business, but the lengthy wait has soured my experience. I hope the company can improve its communication and delivery times. Will update
Really cute, loved the color
They did a good job, my dog is really cute on it!
The embroidery looks great! The package came way later than expected though, but still excited to gift it as a late Christmas present.
I’ve always been hesitant on buying stitched/embroidered items as not many things come out as accurate as presented. This product completely changed my mind on this - I have never seen such accurate replicas of my dogs until I saw the shirt that I purchased. The owner was more than responsive, consistently reaching out, and even asked for my feedback on the drawings before beginning the sewing. 
This is one of the best things I’ve ever bought on Etsy and will certainly not be the last time I purchase from this store. Thank you so much!
This sweatshirt is everything I ever wished for! I really miss my dog even though he’s passed away a few years ago. This was a way I could see my pet again because the it matched so much to the picture I sent for them to use. My new favorite sweatshirt! The owner was very responsive and let me know when it was shipped even when it was late.
Great quality and seller was very quick to respond to my questions.
Great item, but shipping took much longer than expected and communication was in a timely manner, but slightly confusing answers at times. Still would order again when not in the chaos of Christmas.
The hoodie is very good quality. The embroidery doesn't look perfect, but it's still good. The seller took all of our wishes into account when designing it.
I love the item. The embroidery is so accurate and it feels very high quality.
Seller was patient enough to do three iterations of tweaks with me.  The embroidery looks just like the design we discussed.  Recommend the product!
A beautiful reminder of our favorite doggo!
Good quality, results of the Images are awesome. Only the Delivery time with nearly 2 months are Long.
Didn’t arrive on time. Quite slow customer service. Nice item.
My sister loved the sweater. Great customer service and very attentive to the order and how it looks before sending it. Highly recommend.
Just as described! Very lovely
Mervat is very nice and I am absolutely delighted with the embroidery. Absolutely top notch.
Good communication with buyers, send the design, plan to order before the holidays to avoid delays, but otherwise good design very good quality, I highly recommend
i have no idea because i don’t have the item and don’t know when it’s shipping
I think this is the second review I've ever written in my life but I'm so frustrated I had to say something. I ordered a custom sweatshirt early December, initial delivery time was end of month. I contacted the seller multiple times about delivery expectancy and now it's said to be delivered around end of Feb-March, but they still can't promise me that. That's 3-4 months after order. I'm getting a refund but I could had skipped this whole process and ordered from somewhere else on Etsy. There's plenty of other good quality custom designs, don't waste your time. I wasted my time just to get a refund and reorder from somewhere else months later.
I love the sweatshirt. The only problem was the sweatshirt was supposed to be delivered between 12/13-23, which was perfect since it was a Christmas gift. Unfortunately the sweatshirt wasn’t even shipped until 1/2 after I followed up with them. It was disappointing since this was my main present for my sister in law. The sweatshirt looks great, but don’t order if you have any sort of deadline.
Worst customer service. Waited two months and the product never shipped. Seems like a scam even with the other good reviews.
The item itself was of great quality and design. However it took forever to come and the only answer I got was that it was busy due to the holidays. I would order again but not during the holidays.
This person is a scammer.
The item was delivered ONE MONTH after the expected arrival time. And the design of the sweater was not the original agreed upon design. 
I have a pure black poodle, so the design was of a black dog. As you can all see from the attached image, the seller added a brown beard to my poodle.
Took forever to produce and deliver – and then the wrong product was delivered.
Great quality the design was really cute and accurate! Designer was attentive and communicated
The picture is beautiful and matched my photo perfectly.
First thing, the sweatshirt is high-quality and the embroidery matches the design rendering almost perfectly. My main compliant with this order was the processing time. When I originally ordered this item, the description stated a processing time of 5-15 business days. It took about 14 business days to receive the design rendering. A week later I reached out as we were well past the original processing and shipping timeline listed. She quickly responded and let me know that it would be an additional 15 business days, and only then was the item description updated with a new, longer processing time. All in all, it did take about 2 months for this item to make it to me and I would have appreciated better communication about the longer processing times if it differs than what was listed when the item was purchased.
The actual item is wonderful, however when I received it there were tiny threads all over it, and they didn't cut off the ends after finishing sewing it. And on the hood there was one black mark so I have to wash it and see if it comes out. Maybe the size of a dime. Otherwise I love it, the design and detail of the dog is so cute!!
Absolutely Beautiful Item. Had to wait a while for it, But definitely worth the wait
As I said in another review on this product and the creator. Everything is perfect, from communications and assurance the picture was saticfactory, to delivery. So a thrilled step daughter and wife makes my life quite content lol
All in all the turn around was excellent as well as the consideration of the renderings of both doggo's likeness. Great attention was given to ensure I was happy with the result. Prompt communication, with our postal strike now over the delivery was 1 day earlier than expected eh Very emotional pupperz mommy's in this house tonight eh
Had an amazing experience. I wanted to surprise my friend who just lost her special needs dog so the pictures I had weren't perfect but they did a great job! My friend literally burst into tears and kept remarking how much it looked like her dog. Thank you!
Absolutely beautiful! The gift was very loved. Shipping took a little longer than described on the page, but it most likely had to do with customs here in the US. It still arrived before Christmas and brought so much joy. Thank you!
Even better than I imagined ❤️ Love this sweatshirt so much!!
Item was purchased as a gift and she loved it!
Seller was very helpful and replied to messages.
My sister absolutely loved it, which makes it well worth the money. And the quality was incredible. I felt emotional looking it. Would definitely be buying from them again.
Very happy with this purchase, highly recommend! I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister as a keepsake of her 14 year old dog - who is now doing well. I will be ordering myself one as well. High quality and just stunning. Thank you so much 💜
Very good quality product with the type of sweatshirt and design!
Was super vallah good this
very beautiful, and very well done
Unfortunately the seller did not manage their orders in time and caused huge delays and my item when finally arrived started to come undone within a minute of wearing it. I thought I found a great seller, but left with disappointment. I hope they figure out how to manage their time and work so they can do better.
I ordered a "BLANK" sweatshirt.  There was nothing on it.  It wasn't what I needed and I wanted to return it.  This company does not honor returns.  So if your not sure of color or size don't order from this company.  I could understand if there was any embroidery on it, but it was just a plain sweatshirt so that was disappointing.  Plus, I waited around 6 weeks for a plain sweatshirt???
Jumper isn’t very soft, looks nice when on but the inside is really quite scratchy and not good quality. Stitching is well done though and she allowed me to change my mind multiple times throughout the process. Would recommend if you don’t care about a scratchy jumper.
I made a purchase for 2 personalized sweatshirts which arrived over a month and a half after initially placing the order. I had inquired on shipment timing twice, as I needed these items by a specific date as they were gifts, however I never receive a response. I was notified of shipment several weeks later and it took another 2 weeks to be delivered. As a result I was not able to gift these items on time, which was very disappointing. I will most likely not be ordering from this shop again.
*EDIT- when this seller read my review, she offered a refund but ONLY if I change my review to a positive one, which would be dishonest to potential buyers and is against Etsy policies* 
I’m very disappointed in this purchase. The quality of the sweatshirt is horrible. It’s thin and scratchy, it feels incredibly cheap. And even though the preview digital image of my dog looked great, the one that ended sewn on the sweatshirt looks so bad. It doesn’t look anything like my dog. I’d highly recommend finding another seller for this type of purchase. For the price I paid, I really regret this purchase. Between it being ugly and uncomfortable, it won’t be worn and is just a waste.
Terrible customer service. I wouldn’t have minded waiting for the item if the communication had been better. I’m not sure why some people have amazing communication while others don’t but the way this shop is run is poor - why accept new orders end of November for Xmas if they won’t even be delivered by mid January? My order hasn’t shipped yet and there’s 0 communication. Avoid this seller and go with another shop that’ll actually ship your purchase
I ordered two of the sweatshirts and I'm very happy with both of them 😁😁😁
I great communication with small business
Makes a great Christmas gift; my mom loved it!
Quality sweatshirt, awesome embroidery. Answered all of my questions super fast. Communicative and kind. 10/10 will order again.
Well crafted and good customer service :)
Such a cute gift for my mom! Arrived in time for Christmas 🎄
Wonderful product. My friend loved it!
great quality, as described by seller
I am so so happy with the shirt I received. My best friend Oliver passed away in November and I wanted a shirt I could wear to remember him and feel close to him. This is exactly what I needed. Thank you.
Super great gift! My sister loved it, it actually bought her to tears! 
Lovely high quality jumper and the embroidery was very neat as well :)) 
The seller also replied to my messages quickly and was very nice :))
My wife loves her sweater!!!
It’s a great gift and the drawing was really detailed. There are no doubt that it’s my lovely pet
Good quality, and the seller gave drawings in advance to ask for approval before embroidering. I really appreciated seeing them and it turned out wonderful!
No complaints, wonderful! It looks just like Kepler.
The stitching was identical to the photo I submitted! Beautiful work
The sweater was beautiful. It really met my expectations and was adored by my aunt whom I gave it to. My only problem was that it arrived so much later than it was said to. It was supposed to be a Christmas present but arrived later than the date it has said to arrive. But other than that it was perfect. Great quality and worth the price.
Excellent price of good work
GIFT BUYER BEWARE: I placed my order (for a Christmas gift) on November 16, and at the time of purchase the ETA was December 18, well before Christmas. After receiving no updates for 10 days, I contacted the shop inquiring if it would be delivered in time, but the seller gave an unclear and rude response about how they had a large number of orders. The seller did not end up shipping my item until the estimated delivery date, and so I did not receive it until January 9, and obviously couldn’t gift it to the recipient on Christmas. The quality of the item is fine, but if you’re looking for a gift, make sure to order at least 2 months in advance if you want it in time. There’s other sellers with similar products on Etsy so I will just choose someone else next time.
The Item was very nice quality, however the image that was embroidered on to the item was different color than the image that was sent originally. The main issue that I have with this though, is the amount of time it took for the item to arrive. I ordered the item on November 20 and I didn’t receive it until January 8 and it was shipped on January 6. I needed this item for Christmas. I have a hard time believing that they had so many orders for Christmas that mine could not be completed in time.
The seller is back ordered and unable to provide a ship date. I have not yet received the item.
I have not yet received the item and the maker cannot provide a ship date. They are back ordered.
Ordered a sweatshirt with two pets and border, and the final product is fantastic. It is extremely well made and looks simply wonderful. 
The seller was responsive to messages and kept me updated on the status of my order.
The order took several weeks longer than originally anticipated to be shipped, but the final product was worth the wait. Highly recommend.
Lovely item! Embroidery is high quality and looks like my darling mut (which wasn’t easy!) Sweatshirt isn’t the softest on the inside, but I wear it with a base layer anyway. This is adorable, I love it! Highly recommended!
The sweater was absolutely beautiful! Worked well with customer service for the design and to update the shipping address. Very communicative service! And just so happy with how it turned out.
Looks even better than I could have hoped
Great gift! My mother loves it!
My wife absolutely loved it!
Came out perfect! Bought as a gift and they loved it
I got this sweatshirt for my mom’s Xmas gift and omg she absolutely loves it!!!
It was super easy to submit my artwork and make adjustments. It was my favorite Christmas gift that I gave this year. They absolutely loved it!
This sweater was for my sister's partner and she absolutely loved it! She cried! She recently lost her dog that was her soul dog, so this meant a lot to her. The sweater was high quality and the embroidery work was fantastic. I highly recommend!
It turned out so awesome, I’d definitely recommend
Perfect gift, such a lovely well designed item
Above and beyond communication and customer service. The product came out better than I could have ever imagined! My husband absolutely loves it, and we will be ordering again!
Great communication and recognisable as my dog ! Love it
Beautiful work! My mother loved it for her Christmas gift. It arrived later than anticipated due to shipping from so far, but it was well worth the wait!❤️
The embroidered patch sits pretty low on the chest. I ordered a large sweatshirt.
Great work, my wife loved it, the embroidery matches my dog's photo perfectly. Thank you Mervat, I recommend it.
took two months to ship, hard to contact the seller for any questions or updates on the product
Saw all of the great reviews for this product and was excited to purchase it for Christmas. I ordered this in mid-November, and the seller's page said it would arrive in time for the holiday. I received it on December 30. I understand there are delays in shipping around the holiday season, but the seller never communicated this with me. Only after a couple of direct messages did I get a response that "things might not arrive in time for Christmas." As for the product itself, it took weeks to receive a rendering, and the final product did not look the rendering at all. Colors were completely changed, resulting in the image of the dog to not look like our dog. Overall, I am extremely disappointed with this experience as the seller seemed less than enthused to provide a quality product for the price that was charged.
Haven’t received my order yet, already disappointed. I ordered 3 embroidered sweatshirts on Nov 30 and my items have yet to ship. After not receiving the renderings for several weeks, I asked the seller about timeframe and received a run-around response. I ultimately had to abandon this gift for one of the recipients due to extended time to ship. Shop policy says cancellations are accepted if requested before an item has dispatched. I messaged prior to receiving the design then was sent the rendering for that item several days later. The owner attempted to impose a cancellation fee due to the custom design already being completed?! I ended up not being charged but the attempt seemed so dishonest and scammy. Based on these shop practices, inability to ship in a timely manner, and poor communication, I do not recommend this shop.

I can’t speak to the quality of the item because it hasn’t arrived. I ordered the item a week before Thanksgiving with an estimated delivery date of Dec 27th at the latest. it’s now January 4th and it still hasn’t even been made or shipped. The seller was very responsive but I am a bit baffled as to why they continue to accept orders if they are so backed up.
The item which arrived was ok, the image did look like the photo but the sweatshirt color was slightly off and it’s more of a shirt material than sweatshirt. The real issue is that I ordered this in November and estimated delivery was early December, over a week before Xmas. I reached out to the seller multiple times when it became clear that it wouldn’t arrive on time to ask when for any update on time frame and was not given any answer- specifically was told they had many orders and I’d know once the product shipped. I noticed even after my item was delayed and they had identified the problem, the item was still being sold with an estimated arrival date well before the holidays. I ultimately received the order in January. Not only was the product severely late, but customer service was also not helpful at all.
Best gift I’ve ever bought for anyone!
Absolutely love! I love how it is customizable and not a generic picture of the animal breed
Great quality and looked just like my dog! My mom loved it!
The embroidery was very nice and detailed. The person receiving this sweater loved it. Would order again, thank you!
Thanks so much, my daughter loves her hoodie!
Amazing and so easy to do
Great quality, arrived on time, embroidery was perfect.
The quality was excellent and the pink color was better in person! This item was a gift so I cannot speak for how well it will hold up but based on what I see of it, I would buy one for myself!
Great customer service and super friendly
I bought this as a gift and they absolutely loved it! The stitching was beautifully done and high quality. The seller was very kind and super attentive walking me along the entire process. I will definitely repurchase in the future!
Loved the whole experience. It turned out perfect and just what they needed.
Awesome ! Very happy with the end product
It was a christmas gift. My mum started crying when she opened it. Thank you so so much its fantastic quality
This was the best gift ever! Love this shop and the owner!
It’s good didn’t come on time though
Perfect gift for my sister!
Absolutely lovely rendition of our sweet girl, down to the smallest detail. High quality and fast delivery, and every interaction was pleasant!
Definitely the cutest Xmas gift ever!! She’s some tears for sure. Recommend 100%, thank you!
The seller did an amazing job! She provided feedback & we decided to make some changes & it turned out perfectly! It made a great Christmas gift!
This was a Christmas gift for my wife. She liked it so much, it brought her to tears. I was really surprised how well the embroidery was made, it really captured my dog and cat’s essence.
A great gift, it's a good quality sweatshirt and the embroidery turned out really well.
Ordered a sweatshirt as a Christmas gift for my mom. I made sure to put in the order well before Christmas so that it would get here in time (estimated delivery was late November to early December). However, the seller didn’t ship the item until mid-December and the sweatshirt wouldn’t arrive until the 23rd. This was fine, cutting it a bit close, but fine. However, the item was misdelivered to the wrong address (the seller used LaserShip, which is a company notorious for losing/misplacing packages). I reached out to LaserShip, who was no help and only told me to reach out to the seller. I then messaged the seller, who was also no help and tried to direct me to the shipper. So, no sweatshirt in time for Christmas. LUCKILY, whoever received the package eventually dropped it off at my apartment. If they hadn’t, I imagine I’d be SOL
stitching was wonderful but the placement wasn’t exactly what i wanted
My first purchase from this small business and I am a little disappointed. I understand that I purchased during busy season but the hoodie was not what I expected. The embroidery for my dog can loose in some spots, you can see multiple threads poking out. It was also embroidered at an awkward spot, below chest level? Also, I made my purchase early November but did not get confirmation for shipping until around December. :/ it was a gift
Great quality and customer service!
Communication with seller was easy and problem free. Item arrived well packaged and looks perfect! Exactly what I was hoping for and makes a beautiful and thoughtful gift.
i really liked it! so good!
so stinking cute and such a perfect gift for anyone and any celebration!
love it and im sure the kids will love them
love them and im sure the kids will love them too
Love the look of it. Its a gift but I wanted to keep it for myself. I hope it hold up
nicely after washes.
This was ADORABLE. I couldn’t be happier. Thank you!!
Top top top top top
loved working with the shop owner and they were very accommodating. <3
The seller was exceptional in getting back with me and making sure she knew what I wanted. And she done a wonderful job on thr piece and quality is exceptional as well!!
Absolutely love how it turned out!! Thank you for making this I cannot wait to give this to my boyfriend!
I cannot praise this product enough!! It's beautiful and exactly what I was looking for!!
The customer service was high quality and it arrived before scheduled time! It was a great gift.
My sister-in-law loved her gift, it was really well made.
Arrived in time for Christmas, my mother-in-law loved her gift, really very beautiful
I ordered this item on November 18th for Christmas but won’t get it until sometime in January, so disappointed
I ordered this product over a month ago. I was supposed to receive it by Christmas and it still hasn't been made or shipped. Keep getting the run around about how backed up they are.
Ordered on 11/19 for a Christmas present and as of today 12/23 has not been shipped. Would not recommend if you are wanting for a certain time frame.
Keep looking. Unless you want long wait times, poor communication, and bad service, you’re better off going with someone else.
This seller does not care about meeting her estimated delivery windows, so stay away or you’ll have to go through getting a refund because your order didn’t arrive on time. Just go with someone else domestic.
Unless you can wait for a loooong time for your order to arrive, just go with another seller. Don’t know how this seller gets good reviews, but your order will likely not come in the estimated window and communication is awful.
If you’re in the States, just choose another seller, because this one will take too long and customer service is unhelpful and unclear.
Awful, ordered items did not arrive within delivery window so Christmas gifts are out the window.
The product is nice, but shipping takes so long. I understand this is coming from a different country than the one I live in, but the LaserShip company that is used for this order is really awful. My item was lost in the mail (which is not the sellers fault) and I contacted LaserShip customer support which took a week to get back to me. Upon looking up this shipping company, I found that there were many other people who have run into issues with them. My item did eventually arrive though but was delivered at 12AM which was weird...but oh well. Product is nice, seller is helpful. If you have no time restraint then you won't have an issue.
Shipped slow but came out amazing and looks just like our dog
I got this sweater for Christmas for a family member, and it is beautiful. I could not ask for more.  The item matched the description, and it met all the expectations and more. For sure this will be the best gift ever!!!
Was a great gift for my wife!
This was the perfect gift for two of my closest friend this holiday season. 
The seller was so easy to work with & shipped everything on time! 
I wish the sweatshirt itself was just a little nicer. It’s thin & I definitely like expected something a little more plush. 
It’s perfect for a light weight sweatshirt! Pictures just made it look a little thicker. That’s my only complaint though! 
The embroidery is perfect & I couldn’t have been happier with how it turned out!
It was what i expected!
Absolutely amazing, the pets came out perfect. The seller kept me informed the entire time. And even with it coming from another country and being custom made it arrived quick! Just in time for Christmas
It’s so cute! Very great gift, arrived as planned. Customer service was great, sent a planned out design and let me confirm the design before making!
Came out great!! gift for my friend & I think she’s gonna love it!
It did take longer than expected to arrive, but it looks great!
Great gift, end result wasn't as stylised as the listing pictures but still great gift.
I got this as a gift for my wife, and she loved it. The quality is great, it was an easy customer experience, and shipping was a little earlier than expected. An awesome purchase.
very cute christmas gift to give!
Quality of the sweater itself is okay but the stitching of the picture is perfect!
I absolutely LOVE how this shirt turned out!  My sister is going to love her gift too.  Very nicely done.  I am going to have to order one for me now!  Highly recommend!
My mother in law loved it so much! Thank you for your hard work!
Very high quality stitching, fast shipping and amazing communication. Highly recommend
Appreciated the opportunity to see the proof before making the product.
As described, arrived before the shipping estimate!
Good good good good good
Disappointing. I ordered 6 sweatshirts with this seller in November with an estimated delivery date of early-mid December. Seller was not professional and factor in the holiday time, so my order ultimately could not make it in time for Christmas. Any communication from seller was also unclear. Takeaway is that if you plan on purchasing near the holidays, just choose someone else or order even earlier than a month prior. This entire experience has left a bad taste in my mouth.
While the seller was responsive to my messages and the mock up looks good, they did not ship the sweatshirt in time. I wish I could leave a review for the quality of the sweatshirt, but I cannot, because I still have not received it. I ordered this on November 17th, and it's December 21st, and it still has not arrived. I understand that the holidays are a busy time, but I specifically bought this a month ahead of time to ensure it was here by Christmas. I doubt it will be. Again, the sweatshirt looks super cute and I'm sure it's well made, but the shipping time has been disappointing.
The sweatshirt is cute (if a bit large) but dealing with the seller made it almost not worth it. I received my item well past the expected delivery date, and the seller refused to provide me with any tracking information until the day my order arrived - over a month later. By the way, this product comes straight from China which is crazy considering the cost of the product. I’m pretty unhappy with the service overall, though I did eventually receive my product.
I purchased six sweatshirts and am disappointed. Lead time was almost two months, seller communication was curt, first draft of artwork was cartoonish and lacked detail. Seller gave me a difficult time over not using white embroidery on the sleeve. No tracking was provided. Sweatshirts came with a bunch of loose threads and sizing is totally wacky. The medium is bigger than the larges. I don’t know how this product has so many positive reviews, or perhaps quality has suffered as volume has increased. 
Not the quality of gift I was hoping to give my family. Would recommend going elsewhere for the price.
Excited to give this to my mother in law
Very good quality of the product
Very good quality of the product
Good quality sweaters and embroidery is very well done! Exactly what I wanted!!
Great quality, seller was quick to contact and made sure I was happy with the design
They loved the shirt. Thank you
This sweatshirt turned out perfect! Looks just like the picture I sent! Absolutely love it!
Super special and cute! Love it
I gifted this sweatshirt to my mother-in-law. She absolutely LOVED it! It was very easy to order and the seller was very responsive. The design looked identical to the image of the pet. It turned out great! Highly recommend for any pet lovers!
Well made and good quality materials. Perfect gift for my daughter of our two kitties!!
So excited by the way the sweatshirt came out. I can't wait to give it to my mom for Christmas.
I am so in love with my new crew neck! The owner worked with me to get an amazing outcome and was very respectful. I haven't worn it yet but it's super cute, thank you for embroidering my baby on a top!
It turned out amazing!! Such a great gift!
Absolutely love the sweatshirt with our dogs face on it! Got it as a Christmas present for my grandmother, I can’t wait for her to see it! Seller was quick to respond to messages and let me see the design before it was embroidered. I ordered at the beginning of November as I knew shipping could take a while on this custom item coming from Australia. It came within 3 weeks!
Super high quality and arrived on time!  Love it!
Unbelievable quality. I can not wait to give this to my mom as her Christmas gift.
My order came exactly how I expected it. The quality of the embroidery is amazing and came exactly as depicted in the preview sent by the shop owner. Highly recommend, however shipping does take a while so plan accordingly. Otherwise a great product, no remorse!
Beautifully made sweatshirt. The embroidery looked great!
Amazing 
Looks beautiful and matches the photo of my dog perfectly!
Product was amazing! The sweatshirt pictures were identical to the pictures I sent and the customer service was incredible!!
It was everything I wanted. The item is so accurate to the picture and the seller is so professional and fast.
I already left a review for the others we order. Ordered 5 at a time.

This is a good seller and the sweatshirt is cute looking.
The actual sweatshirt doesn't not show as much detail as the render which was a little disappointing.
There are some parts of the embroidery that look like it's fraying. 
We like the quality of the shirt - Soft! 
I did not like the quality of one of the items we wanted and the seller worked with me to make another one and it came before Christmas. The new version looks much more like the original render. Thank you!!
However, overall this is a cute idea!
Incredibile!! Im so in love with this. Took awhile to get to me, but we’re on opposite sides of the world AND its the holiday season. So so worth the wait. Thank you so much!
Loved it would get again
Great gift item. Looking forward to seeing the reaction of the recipient!!
Seller went above and beyond! I requested something and she did it and was so patient and helpful !
So cute and will be my best friend’s new favorite sweatshirt!
Perfect! Shipping was delayed, but it is the holiday season.
The shirt is made of quality fabric. My sister will love it.
Seller is responsive and very accommodating to design changes. My pup was a mix with unique coloring and features so I was worried about the accuracy of the illustration, but the seller did a wonderful job! The sweater is adorable and I very happy to have this as a memorial piece
My daughter loved it. It looked just like her dog. Beautiful embroidery on quality sweatshirt.
Bought it for my best friend and my brothers girlfriend for Christmas and I was excited they arrived on time and there absolutely beautiful will buy from again!
Very very well made I love it
I knew soon as she sent the digital version of it to okay it that it would be so well crafted and she was so nice when I would message and ask questions
Every l thing was great
Awesome. Perfectly crafted and high quality.
Great one of a kind item, I would use this vendor again!
Turned out as I hoped. Thank you!
Turned out great! Thank you
Looks exactly as I hoped!
The embroidery was very well done and was exactly what I was wanting
The sweater turned out really nice and the quality is great too. I also think it's good that you can get a first draft before the sweater is embroidered. My mum will be very happy with her dog sweater.
The saleswoman takes the time to redo the drawing several times if necessary and is very responsive. A gift that was really appreciated. Thank you very much!
Top I recommend 100%
Expectations definitely exceeded, very satisfied
I bought 3 jumpers for my sibblings with cats. While the process to revise and approve the renders is great, it’s basically useless if the embroidered version ends up looking quite different from the render, particularly the color matching. This is a custom product so getting a close likeness to the photo is the whole point and I felt let down by the final result. I bought 3 different sizes and the difference between a small and large was very minor, the large seemed true to size and the small was very big. Also one jumper arrived with lots of loose threads and other bits of material all over it and folded poorly, not very professional looking. Maybe my expectations were too high.
Great sweater, I really like it.
Love the customized sweatshirt and it will make a great gift for my daughter with an embroidered image of her dog. I had some challenges communicating with the seller but ultimately the product was worth it. Allow for shipping time as this product comes from Australia and it takes a while. Tracking was challenging, showing the product was coming from IL and I received no updates until it arrived.
Loved the sweatshirts and the embroidery was perfect. Knocked one star off as the package arrived later than the original date span, but still loved it!
This sweater is super cute! Wonderful quality! My dogs and cat🩷🩷🩷The sweater is soft, too. The seller was nice! My husband was so happy:) holiday a busy time of the year, so I recommend ordering ahead of time. Mine took a month to receive it. The best gift ever! Thank you💖
Can't wait to give this as a Christmas present. The embroidery is brilliant and exactly what I wanted. Very impressed with the likeness despite the few awful quality photos I had. Sweater definitely runs large though. The M is closer to a L/XL
The item met my expectations
What an amazing jumper as a birthday present, very high quality and quick delivery
Absolutely love this sweatshirt.  It is just what I wanted.  Great quality.  Fantastic customer service.  So many compliments on it! Glad I found your site!  Thanks!
When things are super customized, I am always nervous of the outcome. I was able to send multiple photos and get a look at the design to approve before moving forward. Came out amazingly and the person I gifted it to absolutely loves it. 
I will most definitely be ordering again from this seller and recommend it for anyone looking to do a customized sweater of their lil loved one.
So cute and makes a very thoughtful gift!
Brilliant communication and just what I was looking for
Great product. Accommodating artist. Prompt shipping
Seller was great to work with and provided the perfect gift for this birthday gift!
This shop is amazing! The seller did an amazing job at getting the details right and getting to the product to me at a reasonable time! Will definitely buy from here again!
Was a gift and she loved it
We are so happy with the product it came earlier than expected and the seller is great to work with we will be returning customers
Great sweatshirt, matches the photo sent. Perfect for a gift!
I am very satisfied with the product. Very nice seller. Thank you very much 🤗
I am very satisfied with the product. Very nice seller. Thank you very much 🤗
I am very satisfied with the product. Very nice seller. Thank you very much 🤗
Very friendly customer service and always easy to reach and also asked if the design fits
Attentive saleswoman, she followed the adjustments I had requested on the drawing. She sent photos at each step of the process. Arrived quickly, perfect gift
Very well done and she is very kind
Corresponded to the description, mega beautiful
The sweatshirt is beautiful. Thank you so much, and thank you for the great communication.
So happy with this hoodie. The sizing is a little on the bigger side but it’s 100% cotton so it worked out perfect. I absolutely love the way it turned out and I now have the perfect way to bring my pup into work with me.
I highly recommend the shop, I purchased this as a gift, at first I was a little nervous since the item wasn’t going to arrive on the time I needed and it was well worth the wait. My friend absolutely loved her sweatshirt, amazing color very high end details. I give it 10 stars!!!!
Loved it. Great quality and so cute
Excellent product and beautifully crafted.
Was very helpful and does great work
Beautiful work! Absolutely love showing it off.
Seller was great. Quality was great. Brought my mom to tears! Thank you.
My item came out great and I even purchased a second. My only complaint is that my dog has two different color eyes and the shirt didn’t have that. It had my dog with brown eyes. Still looks like her though
I would highly recommend !
I liked the quality and it was really easy to make adjustments with the team!!
This was a gift for a friend of mine whose dog had sadly passed away. She absolutely adored this sweater.
So excited to give my niece this gift! Stitching is thick and way bigger than I expected which is cool. I recommend
Loved it! Met my expectations and more
This sweatshirt is amazing. I’ve been looking for one that I could put my animals on it and I found it. I’ve gotten so many compliments on this sweatshirt, and my mom‘s neighbor even asked where she could get one.
The shirt looked nice. Made a great gift for my partners birthday. The colours were not as accurate as I would have liked, but it worked.
the perfect gift, he loved it!
Everything came as described, and the quality is great! Seller reached out promptly with proofs as well. Couldn’t be happier!
I love it.  My Toby passed away in February and it looks just like him.
A great sweatshirt, fit perfectly and made the party. The embroidery is just as per the original picture. Amazing gift, thank you!
Very grateful for the shop owner's responsiveness. This gift is exactly what my mother wants and I cannot wait to give it to her.  (The owner is willing to do unconventional pets as well! I did a horse!)
This was a great product and my friend loved her gift!
Just amazing! My daughter loves it!!
The designer is a dynamic and kind person, however the final result did not satisfy me. What particularly disappointed me was that we did not have the chance to observe the product with the first requested modifications. The result does not really match the ferret, and if I could express my point of view on the requested adjustments, it is very likely that I would have requested additional changes before sending. I will try to rearrange some details myself before offering the present, but I am not convinced that it will be possible for me. At least the quality of the sweater is good.
The shirt still tight on my husband. I got the biggest size. The shirt is good quality, embroidery quality is good as well.. hope they make more option on the t shirt sizes..
My wife loves this sweatshirt. Our precious dog is embroidered so accurately.
Perfect christmas gift for pet lovers!
Very well done and good quality
So Adorable~ ✨😭🥰 look at my baby~
Got matching ones for my best friend and I’s birthdays with our cats on it and we both loved them so much! Not expensive for the quality (especially if you buy two) and the embroidery looks amazing!
Great communication and love the item, excited to wear it!
LOVE!!!! SO AMAZING!!! EXCITED TO GIFT THIS
I cant wait give my mom for xmas!
Great design, quick creation, super nice quality, my girlfriend loves it!
I will definitely be back to buy more!
I’m very happy with my custom pet hoodie. Seller was more than happy to make adjustments to the design until I was happy. It was shipped out quickly and arrived very quickly. Hoodie isn’t super thick and warm but will do the trick!
The entire process was a dream! It was easy to communicate as well as be able to feel apart of the process! Not to mention how good of quality my sweater is
It was a fantastic product and as described. The image of our dog was so accurate and beautiful.
Exactly what I was looking for
Very communicative and handled everything so professionally even when I forgot to respond and didn't answer her questions. All around great experience and now my friend has a cute sweater to remember her sweet beloved pet!
Beautiful materials, perfect likeness of the photos I sent.  I love it 🖤
Good quality and customer service
The sweater is super beautiful and perfect as a gift for my sister :)
Great, quality embroidery, corresponds well to the visual provided after ordering.
Sweatshirt of correct quality, correct size.
I recommend!
. . . . .
This came from china? Sweatshirt is a bit starch and scratchy
I paid so much money for these and they came from china?
The picture is smaller than I thought, but still really cute and comfy.
Great item! Very good quality. Good communication from seller. Took a while to get here but worth the wait.
Very quick and great at responding. The sweatshirt came out better than I could have imagined. Plus it made it from Australia to NY super quick!
Colors were slightly different than the design picture, but great quality
Amazing every time and high quality
The sweatshirts turned out great!
The sweatshirts turned out amazing!
I love how it looks and feels!! It’s definitely high quality and well made!! I’m considering buying another for myself since this one was a gift for a cousin!
I got this for my step sister for Christmas with her two dogs and the embroidery is done so well! The designs were super cute and when I asked for a change they were accommodating and got back to me very quickly. The design is  bigger than I had initially thought they'd be which is nice. It was well packaged, but unfortunately the tracking didn't work for me and it just told me one day it had been delivered and even though I was home, no one knocked at the door and they just left the package in front of my house. Obviously that is no fault of the seller but thought I'd mention why I didn't give 5 star for delivery. Generally super happy with it though and now I want one of my own!
I love it. I ordered it to be the Christmas gift that Santa brings mommy. My kids will be super impressed
This was a gift. She loved it
Super good quality!! She did an absolute amazing job on the stitching and the design. True talent!!
it came at the time it was supposed to, the creator reached out super fast. I loved it!!
The embroidery looks amazing and just like my dog! I will be ordering more!
Super cute and the quality was amazing! The embroidery was on point and was exactly the same as the images I provided. Would highly recommend! I'll definitely purchase again soon ☺️
Great gift for dog lover
The photo looks just like Jaxx! I got them as gifts for family friends. I ordered 2 one with a wreath and one without. They didn’t put the wreath which is fine, it was my mistake for not correcting it. Just make sure when they send the rendering check the wreath if you get it. Still perfect and they were the best gifts.
Seller did a great job communicating about the design
Great quality and comfortable. She sent us a preview of the sweatshirt design prior to making it to assure it was what I wanted and it was perfect.
Everything was perfect. I sent this directly to my best friend, and she loves it. It was the perfect gift to give her as her dog was put down a month ago after losing her battle with cancer.
I had this in my cart forever and finally ordered it! I love it so much! 
The quality is amazing!! It’s truly everything I wanted, shipping was fast and the sellers communication is great ! I will order from this shop again !
The hoodie was embroidered with love and attention to detail. I am delighted. The processing and shipping were quick. I am completely satisfied.
It's a Christmas present for my boyfriend. It looks really pretty, is of good quality and my wishes were taken into account. So I recommend it. :)
True to the article, very good quality I recommend
love it! took about 3 weeks to arrive but understandable since it’s international shipping!
I love it! It is perfect!
Really good jumper and the picture was superb! Would recommend to others
Turned out perfectly. Very happy with my sweater 😊
The seller made sure I was okay with the mock up and the final embroidery before shipping the product, great customer service!
The sweatshirts I ordered are beyond perfect.  The design process was very simple and shipping was quick.
The item turned out so darn cute!! My friend actually got tears in her eyes when she saw it! The seller was great to communicate with and told me what reference pics would work better for her and then sent me the final design before embroidering. The jumper is perfect for Australian weather,cozy without being too fleecy as well. The design looked just like her too. Super cute present,thank you!!
This was exactly what I was hoping for! Great!
This item is so amazing! The embroidery looks just like the proof sent by the seller. This is going to be a perfect Christmas gift
Extremely kind and quick to help me with my custom order
Very good quality, my girlfriend loved it. The embroidery looks just like her dog!
Very cute and meaningful it will make the best gift ! The whole process was very easy and the owner was very nice and helpful!
Soo soo cute my sister is going to love it! I looks just like my puppy
It is just like I order. The perfect gift
I bought one sweatshirt for myself. Will be ordering again for a gift.
Absolutely loved the dog embroidered sweatshirt! It looked just like my sisters dog and I was actually able to customize the flowers even more by doing them in a different color then shows on the website. Overall the owner was super sweet and the product looks incredible!
The sweatshirt and the embroidery were high quality. This is a fantastic gift!
Great service and good communication!
Love this and cant wait to see my husbands face when I give it to him for his birthday. He will love it.
Absolutely love it! The detail is fantastic. I asked to approve the design before it got embroidered due to my choice of photo but it turned out perfectly!
My partner loved his hoodie with his kitten's face; makes him smile every time!
Had a small issue on my original order that was quickly corrected. And I couldn't be happier with my purchase and the customer service!!
I ordered a hoodie and they sent me one without a hood.
Item arrived damaged, after it was the second time I bought it again. The print, among other things, was different from the one agreed, because I had specifically asked for my cat's nose to be pink, which was its characteristic. Also, according to the size indications, the first time the size L was huge, even buying a size S as it was written on the card, it was still huge... However, the neck and part of the print were ruined, so the sweatshirt ended up in the trash. The second time, they refunded me asking me to change the terrible review I had written on the first sweatshirt, and so at least they were prompt in the refund and I appreciated the customer service. The print, if there had not been the mistake with the nose, would have also been very nice. The cost was 65 euros, not the one written!
Great design and quality. The sweater size Small runs a bit large though. Might need XS if you’re more petite
Above and beyond!
Beautiful craftsmanship-
really resembles my two awesome Aussies! Thanks!
Loved the sweater! Great quality and super accurate compared to photo I sent. My girlfriend loves the gift, and all the different colors, fonts, and patterns make this a really unique item
Wonderful quality; beautiful attention to detail
I love your work! The sweatshirt is an amazing present! Thank you very much!
I wanted a crewneck with my puppy on it and this turned out great!!
Great work and responses are quick
Excellent seller communication. Quickly answered any queries and fixed changes fast! High quality products delivered as described.
A fantastic item, and the shop was super accommodating and helpful.
Great! Wonderful! Even better than expected!
What a great gift for my son. It truly depicts his dog Jasper.
Amazing gift to give to someone! Everyone I’ve given it to has loved it! Did take a bit to get Canada, so I would order earlier then later
Both of my friends loved the gift! They immediately recognized it as their own pet! The clothing was good quality and customer service great!
It looks really good, my husband liked it. The size is XL is too tight on him he's XL.
It's good my husband like it. The size is too tight on him his XL..
Mervat is a pleasure to deal with, very responsive and nice. Got my girlfriend a shirt of our dogs and she absolutely loves it. Great quality all around and Mervat nailed my dogs likeness. If you're going to get a shirt like this, get it done by this shop.
Amazing quality and work! Highly recommend for anyone thinking about gifting a dog mom or dad
Can’t wait to gift this for Christmas!
The sweaters came out so good! I'm really impressed. I was worried that my dogs wouldn't translate well since they're mostly black but I was wrong! It's getting colder and i love wearing my dogs.
Got it as a gift for my partner 
 whose cat had recently passed and it was delivered on time and I'm blown away by the quality. Highly recommend and was extremely helpful with my further enquires about the item
my mom loved it! It was the perfect gift!
Made an amazing portrait based on the only image we had of our dog 10 years ago. It came out looking better than we had thought!
I am very satisfied, beautiful sweater and great customer service.
Thank you very much for the gift that was much more. There is a difference between the photo and the real thing.
Really good product and service
Good quality material and the embroidery is lovely and spot on with the photo I sent.
I loved the mockup she sent me prior to stitching it, and the finished product was even more beautiful! She communicated with me so kindly and was very responsive and helpful. Also, the sweatshirt itself is high quality!
Looks amazing! Satisfied with my purchase.
Bought as a birthday present and it was perfect
It was a great gift, very well made!
I bought this for my best friend who had recently unexpectedly lost her beloved girl. She absolutely loves the sweatshirt and I do too! Such great quality! The sweatshirt looks exactly like the photo I sent it!
perfect! just as promised, and lovely service!
It was a present for my friend and she absolutely LOVED it. Cried. It was almost perfect! However, the track & trace sadly didn’t work (not sure is this something she can do anything about). Contact with the shop was very nice!
The names on the sleeve, one seemed to have a bit of a faulty in it, the letter was crooked and it looked “broken”. See photo. It was very small, and not too noticeable, would still very much recommend!
I bought this for a gift for our dog trainer who had recently had a dog of hers pass away. She loved it and I think it makes a great gift!
The communication from start to finish was excellent. The sweater turned out perfectly!
Absolutely perfect as described, maybe even better. Fantastic quality and exceeds my expectations. For this price, this is a steal. Easily the best money I’ve spent for the happiness it brought my partner.
Wonderful job with shirt everything I wanted!
absolutely beautiful sweatshirt! the embroidery is very nice, detailed and true to my photo.  love it so much!
It was absolutely perfect my girlfriend loved it
It is beautiful!
There was a mix up with my order but it got sorted put very quickly and without any problems. Very happy with the result.
My grandpa loves it!
High quality and amazing service!
Beautiful quality it waa a gift and she loves it!
Great gift! Communication with the sellers is great and the sweater looks great. The only potential downside is that the embroidery on the inside of the sweater is a bit rough, so you have to wear a t-shirt otherwise it would be scratchy. But otherwise absolutely fantastic! Great work :D
Thank you very much, our father will love the memory of his dog!
Such a great sweater. The embroidery is of very good quality! Before the sweater went on the long journey to Germany, I received a first draft and a photo of the finished embroidery. Very fine customer service. It's a shame that I only have these two animals :D
Really good quality, the stick looks exactly like the submitted pictures.
Very nicely done, only the hoodie itself could be of better quality. But overall very happy with the item☺️
The quality of the sweater is great, a bit thinner than I thought but still awesome. The embroidery is high quality and the seller was super nice and patient too! After a couple of revisions to the design, the design came out perfectly and I couldn’t be happier :)
Very quick to answer and easy to work with.
It was absolutely perfect! The quality and customer service was fantastic!!
Love this jumper, the seller was super helpful in making it perfect for me!
Awesome customer service I love the design It’s just perfect, thank you so much!
Extremely helpful when I asked to see the design, my friend loved it!
It is a beautiful sweater!
What an amazing find!  Hoodie was very well made, and true to size.  I sent my puppy’s picture, she sent me a proof before starting, I requested a tweak, she obliged willingly and sent me another proof after the tweak. Absolute perfection! After receiving the hoodie, I was VERY pleased at the flawless design and quality of stitching. I highly recommend this seller. Couldn’t be happier with this purchase!
LOVE this sweatshirt! Was a gift for my mom's birthday & she loved it too! Would highly recommend!
Amazing sweatshirt. Looks just like my dog. The artist did such a great job and communication was really good.
The shirt was too small for my boyfriend and I got and XL but that’s probably because it wasn’t an American size so that’s on my part. But the embroidery was so so cute!
great customer service, quick fast communication, fast delivery, awesome service thank you
Was great and responded to my questions in a timely manner.
Love it so much!! Definitely would order again
so happy with the end result, and it made the perfect gift. my wife never takes it off!
Great quality, I definitely recommend!
I’ve received the package on time and in a perfect parcel. The owner has followed all my instructions and has perfectly reproduced the pictures I sent her. Nice job!!! Definitely recommend it!
I’ve received the package on time and in a perfect parcel. The owner has followed all my instructions and has perfectly reproduced the pictures I sent her. Nice job!!! Definitely recommend it!
Ordered this item as a gift and it was perfect! The proof of the embroidery matched exactly what I got.
The product is of excellent quality and is very well made. The seller is very nice - I am completely satisfied and would happily buy again!
Service was simply amazing! I requested a certain date for it to arrive and they expedited the process to get it to me on time! I was able to change the design before the sweater was made. Unfortunately the colors came out differently than the design so it doesn't look exactly like my own rabbits, but overall very happy with it!
The sweatshirt is good quality but the embroidery doesn’t really look like my dog. The color is off and the quality is low. I actually ordered another from a different seller without realizing that I had gotten two until today when this one came in the mail. I am happy I have the other one because I think I would be upset if I just got this one.. 
in my photo the one on the left is from this seller, the one on the right is from a different seller.
This item takes a very long time to ship. The digital proof looks like the dog I sent a picture of, but the physical product did not. They added a lot of brown to a blue pit that has no brown at all on his body. This is supposed to be a gift for a friend whose pup is terminally ill and I wanted the embroidery to look like him. I messaged the seller after I received my item and no response. This item was very expensive to experience poor quality and poor customer service. Would not recommend.
I had to buy this sweatshirt twice. The first time it arrived two sizes too large, despite the size of the folder. The second time it arrived completely ruined in several places!!!!!!! Scandalous.
Great quality sweatshirt. Good response time for all questions
Excellent quality! We got this as a gift for my sister as she got a puppy this year and she loves it! It is well-made, came on time and came in good condition. The seller sent me a drawing before creating the shirt for my approval, which was very helpful.
It was perfect, this is a great gift for a friend
Great quality item, came exactly as advertised. Seller was easy and quickly responsive when I submitted the photo. Was a gift and she loved it! Shipping and delivery took longer than anticipated, but - in all fairness to the seller - it was an international order (I live in mainland US).
Seller was extremely diligent and made sure she got my dogs just right. I was so impressed with her attention and desire to get it right.
Absolutely in love with how this turned out!
excellent in all areas, customer service, the beautiful rendering, everything! highly recommend
I got a pink sweater with my since passed black lab’s face over the heart and she turned out so cute. Gave it to my mother who missed her dearly, and she has worn that sweater every day since. A very sentimental gift for anyone loving a lost pet, so that you can always have a piece of them at home.
Highly recommend, I'm also going to purchase another two because the first one was so good!
The embroidery was a lot more detailed than what i thought it would be, looks great!
I bought one of the sweatshirts as a gift for a friend. send over a bunch of pictures of the dog that we wanted on it. We were sent a render image first to check if we liked it. They actually changed this render twice to add my requests. 
The sweater is of fine quality and the embroidery looks amazing! 
Overall, a great present for my friend and a lovely and helpfull creator!
I love it so much!!!
Absolutely loved the sweatshirt! So soft and cozy! The embroidery was perfect!
Bought this for a friend who lost her precious dog. It turned out beautiful and looked exactly like her dog. She absolutely loved it and can’t wait to wear it in the winter months to keep her warm ❤️
My new favorite shop. Got one as a bday gift for my girlfriend (photo attached!)
They were so nice and attentive with everything I needed, and the final product is BEAUTIFUL. I’m so happy I got one, and for sure I’ll get another one in a nearby future. Thank you so much :)
Seller sent me drafts for adjustment and approval before confirming embroidery. Sweater is nice quality and arrived in time for a birthday present. Thank you.
Amazing quality!!! Quick shipping. The owner is the absolute best communicator!!
As some of the other reviews mention, the sweater quality itself isn’t 100% but the design makes up for it! So happy with how mine turned out.
It is everything I wanted it to be, so so cute!!
Great quality, beautifully made and such a nice gift!
It turned out really nice, even though our dog has a black head, the embroidery turned out great. Highly recommended!
Good response from the saleswoman
The end result looked really good, highly recommended
I absolutely loveee how it came it, definitely my favorite sweatshirt now ❤️🐶
Love the sweatshirt, but I would recommend sizing up! We washed the sweatshirt and unfortunately, it shrunk. Now the arms are too short. :(
Fiance adored it! Perfect for a surprise gift
great product, lovely exchange with the artist, overall very positive experience
Holy smokes! This is the second sweatshirt I’ve purchased from here, and they’re just fantastic! Both my sister and brother-in-law recently lost their dogs of 16 years. My sister is often seen wearing what she affectionately calls her “Harley sweatshirt,” and my brother-in-law just received his, just in time for the weather to change in Washington. I definitely recommend these!
This jumper is so cute! I got it for my friend for her birthday and she loves it. The quality is really good and I’d defo purchase from here again!
Wonderful seller! Incredible work thank you so much.
Loved the tshirt of my puppers!
Great gift idea, really good quality embroidery however the jumper itself quality isn’t amazing, would like to have an option to pay for a more premium material. Great seller, communication throughout, arrived sooner than expected.
I was going to wrap this beautiful sweater as a Christmas gift (yes I shop early) our pup passed away about a year ago. When it arrived it was so beautifully made that I gave it to her on the spot, lots of tears of happiness ! Highly recommend this. ❤️thank you so much
Amazing communication and even better work! Absolutely beautiful!
Item is exactly as i wanted it to be! Looked amazing! Would definitely recommend this to anyone :) 10/10
Absolutely stunning, perfect gift to give
It turned out absolutely amazing!! The seller was super easy to talk to and make any changes necessary! Extremely happy with my purchase!!
Fantastic product!!!!! such a great gift idea that I’m getting one for myself too. The shirt is high quality and the seller was extremely helpful and responsive with all my inquiries for the order. Highly recommend!
They were very quick to respond and helpful when needed.
Great product and very high quality material, was a great gift!
I love my jumper! Great quality. As described. Excellent communication. Thank you
Beautiful well crafted highly recommend
Absolutely obsessed!!
The seller did an absolutely amazing job communicating  with me to refine and get the perfect design before going ahead with anything - I am super happy with the quality and will forever be wearing my sweatshirt with my dog on it:))
It's PERFECT! I knew it was going to look amazing but in person it's beautiful and so well done. Definitely recommend as a gift for someone who has a furbaby
very responsive and helpful with adjustments when colors didn't initially align due to the image's lighting. final product was lovely — thank you!
Personalized and very well attended. Everything was of great quality. Recommended.
Took a long time to get proof from seller and shipping, embroidery also a bit sloppy and misshapen
Amazing gift, seller was helpful and the product looked perfect
Love the final design :) Captured the likeness of my pets beautifully. Definitely recommend. Great communication around updates from the seller as well.
I purchased this for my boyfriend who is obsessed with his dog, Mars.
I haven't washed it yet, so I'm unsure how it will look post wash, but am happy with the quality of the tshirt used and extremely happy with the embroidery!
I requested a mock-up be provided as I was concerned about my choice of photo. It was an easy and pleasant process.
Unfortunately, the item arrived just after his birthday and the day he flew overseas for a short trip, however, was delivered within the estimated timeframe, so that's all on me. He'll have a nice surprise when he gets home.
Sorry the photo isn't the best, I left it at his place, so don't have access to take another.
This was a gift for my sister, she loved it! Thank you so much 😊
I am so happy, that I ordered a hoodie here for my boyfriend's birthday. It came out absolutely perfect. Cats on the embroidery look so much like his own 🥺 Thank you for super nice and fast service ❤️❤️❤️
Great gift for any occasion! Love it! Definitely wanna order more
Came out beautiful! Great gift idea and highly recommend!
Absolutely adorable and just as expected. Very high quality and great design. Customer service was top notch. Very happy with my purchase!
I love it!!! Communication was great and it totally came out better than I had expected. Looks so much like my dog, it made me tear up because he’s not mine anymore. Now I get to have a piece of him everywhere I go.
Love it so much, the artwork is so well done and can’t wait to gift to my friend.
really nice sweatshirt and the custom embroidery is amazing, thank you!
Great customer service! Highly recommend!
It's so cute!! I love it so much, can't wait for winter so I can start wearing it!!
Thank you so much! She absolutely loved it ☺️
The quality is very solid. The material is nice and heavy without feeling unbreathable. The embroidery amazed me with its details! Absolutely a great purchase and would recommend to anyone who’s eying this item.
I adore it! I ordered two of these sweatshirts with 2 different photos and I am so happy with the way they turned out. Embroidery looks very pretty, sweatshirt is good quality and it looks exactly like the image the vendor sent me to confirm what I wanted. The exchanges with the vendor were very nice and I felt listened. I could give one more star!
Overall, it's cute. There are some stray threads I'm going to have to figure out how to get rid of because they're really short. That's just me being nitpicky though.
I purchased this item as a gift and my partner loved it. I loved the customization options and the portrait turned out great. The only thing keeping this from being a 5-star item is that the measurements of the hoodie aren’t standard. The length of the sleeves is very short in comparison to the chest size, hoodie length, etc., so it was very difficult to find the right sizing and the sleeves did end up being too short. Overall, though, I am happy with my purchase.
Recieved amended order, thank you!
Gave this to my boyfriend's mom for her birthday in remembrance of her best boy, and she loved it!!  It came out great!
love it so so much!
In the top. The saleswoman is very attentive to personalizing the design. Exchanges are fluid and fast.
The order arrived much earlier than expected.
Item quality was amazing, I was disappointed delivery and customer communication
So beautifully well made and great service! Such a great gift for a doggo lover.
looks great! and great customer service
They really took the time to make sure I approved of all things before starting to embroider. Was able to really capture the personality of the dog!
I ordered 3 sweaters to give as gifts, and they all turned out fantastic!! The embroidery is so detailed and true to the pictures I sent in, the quality of the sweaters is top notch, and Mervat was wonderful to deal with! Plus, my order arrived much more quickly than I expected. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a lovely sweater customized with your pet on it!
Great embroidery, and the quality of the jumper is great too.
The service was very attentive and helped me throughout the process of ordering. Will be ordering again in future.
Owner worked with me on the design. Extremely high quality product, and represented our recently passed pup so well. This was really meaningful for us and my wife loves it. Thank you so much!!
I’m OBSESSED with my sweater with all my fur babies on it. Their little expressions are so clear too. My friends are asking for her page to get their own!
So helpful to ensure the design was the perfect example of photo.
Beautiful design and quality. Will definitely order again!
They were great in adjusting the image to my preference! My friend absolutely loved her gift and said it looks exactly like her pup!
Love ours so much!! Getting more to gift my friends and family!
Great communication with seller and crafted with care! I love my sweater
This arrived nearly a month ahead of time and was so thoughtfully made! My friend adores it and wears it often to remember her childhood pet who passed away. Thank you for this treasured item 💜
Very nice, good quality work! Seller is very responsive and flexible with requests. I'm looking forward to giving this to my friend.
Second purchase from this shop — great quality!
Got this for my baby boy who I lost earlier this year, and my friend’s who lost hers a few years prior. The owner was so sweet and patient with my many questions and requests. She handles everything with grace and my friend and I cried when we got our sweaters in. My heart is broken from losing my baby, and this sweater usually stays on the side of the bed he used to sleep until it’s cold enough to wear, but it’s something that truly warms me knowing so much care was put into making my baby look as beautiful as he is on my sweater. For my little Yoshi that is no longer with me, this sweater will keep me warm until we meet again…
I see it every day and remember how much love I have for him, so thank you from the bottom of my heart for giving me such a beautiful piece that I will cherish forever and keep dear to my heart.
Customer service was exceptional! The quality of sweater and the embroidy were both top notch! Definitely recommend.
This product is so beautiful and you can tell that this is going to last for a long time. Delivery took a little while - just make sure you account for that if you are ordering for birthday or Christmas. Overall, fantastic!!
Matched descriptions, beautiful, timely, quality is great.
Amazing embroidery quality! The seller was very quick with responding and designing the art of my partners cat, and it came out really great - they loved it!

Seller was friendly and very communicative. I lost my 14 year old best friend unexpectedly and I love this sweater.
This sweatshirt was high quality and was a perfect rendering of Daisy! I ordered this sweatshirt for my best friend for her birthday and she is obsessed. Great quality, definitely a must buy for any dog owner!
very good made from the heart
I loved it so much!!! It's perfect 🖤
So perfect. Design was exactly what I wanted.
Such a cute sweatshirt. Got for a gift and she loved it!
This was a part of a gift that we got for our friends after their pup had passed. They loved it. The hoodie material is of good quality and the design was exactly like the render provided.
excellent sweater with great craftsmanship
Super helpful and responsive when making this for my friend's birthday!
Looks just like my babies
Super responsive seller! Checked in to make sure I got exactly what I wanted when I forgot to list my desired border/font. The graphic was perfect and the shirt is high quality material. Great job!
The embroidery and the resemblance to the picture I sent came out absolutely stunning! Mervat was super nice and the shirt arrived on time - thank you so much! 🌼
My mom loved her gift I got !
Amazing quality and came in on time!
This is perfect and I love the way it turned out!
My mom loved this gift with her bunnies on it!
Very good quality and effective
The embroidery is really beautiful, she was very good and kind <3
The only flaw is the quality of the sweatshirt, it's not soft, actually a little stiff and, honestly, for the price paid I expected more :(
Great seller. Answered questions and even made alterations for me. Product looks amazing and quality is great. Highly recommend.
I appreciated how responsive the seller was.
Very responsive to all questions I had
I'm really pleased how the hoodie turned out. Great communication, great work and a very quick delivery. Thank you so much :)
This was such a great gift!
Very cute on the sweatshirt. I’m sure I’ll enjoy wearing it this winter
The quality of the shirt is great as well as the embroidery. What I found nice is that you get shown the design before they embroider it so it looks like ypu want it. I am really happy I ordered it!
Very nice quality and exactly as advertised
This item looked great, was shipped with care, and was great quality!
Great communication. Excellent work and quality.
Excellent service and exactly what I wanted!! Thank you so much!!
Incredible hoodie. The embroidery looks just like her dog. Will make a great present!
This is a fantastic gift! My wife loved it. It captured our groodle perfectly.
Seller did an amazing job. Super cute and great quality. Also, they send you a picture of the rendering for approval and the picture can be downloaded as well. It's like getting a free custom gift with your sweater.
The sweatshirt turned out amazing and was shipped and delivered on time. I would definitely purchase from this seller again. Thank you so much for creating such a beautifully detailed gift!
The piece arrived on time and is extremely well made. My mom was thrilled with her Mother’s Day gift and the perfectly accurate depiction of our beloved family dog.
Got this for my besties birthday and her pup loved it too! So much he stole it
Very helpful to deal with
I loooove my sweater! It looks great and response time and communication with seller was quick and pleasant!
Excellent shirt! I love it so much!
This is by far the cutest sweater and it looks just like my girl
I bought this as a gift for my friend who recently lost her cat. She loved the sweater, it was beautiful and very well made, thank you <3
Good product quality, delivery a little long but the result is good
Magnificent and really well done! Very satisfying
I get so many compliments on this crewneck! It is great quality and I’m so happy with the design :)
The sweater is super cute and comfy!
It came out great and the fit was comfy.
This sweatshirt is soo adorable and has my favorite 4-legged friend ok there!
Great communication and great quality sweater. My husband loved it!
Sweater looks great, and the design is perfect, looks just like our dog. Very cute and the colors are good. However, the sweater isn't very comfortable due to the embroidery not having a soft back on the inside. It is rough and scratchy where the design is on the inside, so it can only be worn with a thick undershirt.
Overall it is a good buy as long as you are aware that you will need a thick undershirt to wear.
Customer service was great and the designer was great to work with.
Loveeeed it! My MIL was so happy
Item as described. Great quality and CS. Was delivered while still showing as waiting to be dispatched so I wasn’t clear on when it would arrive but the product is quality
This item is perfect! The quality is truly 20/10. I went with this shop after looking at many due to the review photos & every single order being SPOT ON. Even after knowing that, I still could not believe how truly identical their work was to my dogs photo. This is the most perfect sweatshirt for my husband & I to each have to remember our sweet boy. I will definitely be recommending this shop as well as ordering more in the future! She truly blew our expectations out of the water & we are so thankful to have our shirts! Something we will cherish forever.
I absolutely love my new sweatshirt & it’s exactly how it is described. I’ve gotten so many compliments on it. So in love, it is so perfect
Great product, as described, great communication with seller

The image designed was perfect!  Easy to communicate with re:specifics.  My daughter LOVES hr gift!!
Amazing results! I'm very happy!
Great gift! She loved it
This came out exactly as I’d hoped! The quality was great, and it actually arrived ahead of the expected delivery date. Would definitely recommend.
Shirt fabric was high quality, and the embroidered part was beautiful, thank you.
Got it as a birthday present for my sister and she loved it!
Shirts came out great. Seller was very helpful
LOVED this item. The image was spot on and the quality was amazing.
Mervat just did a amazing job ! Im in love of my hoodie with my Mango i recommend at 100% ! She did a great and also she make sure than you will love the result, thank you so much DreamLakeStudio ♡
Ordered for a friend whose dog was sick and wanted to get this for her. Arrived the day after she passed so it made for a really special gift for her. Quality, customer service and timeframe was amazing. They sent proofs over for approval before making which was super helpful. 
Would purchase again for sure.
My requests were listened to
I bought a pre made design from this shop before and recommend that! Personally did not like this item, the design created on the first go and shown to me was great and representative of my dog but the reality was the shadowing translated poorly, the sweater seemed less quality too compared to their duck embroidered crew. Worth the try but wish I didn't
My wife loved the sweater quality is really nice!
Amazing quality and the cutest artwork! The best gift possible for pet parents.
This was absolutely better than I expected! She’s loved the gift and cried when she saw our pet on the sweater!
This was a really special gift to my sister and she adored it. Thank you!! 🥹
I bought this for my sisters birthday and she loves it! It’s quite thin so not good if in a cold environment and not super soft but apart from that absolutely amazing
I got this as a gift for my sister and it turned out better than I could have imagined! Mervat was so accommodating and the sweatshirt was incredibly well crafted! Highly recommend it to anyone who’s considering
Made sure that it was what you wanted and sent progress pictures
My mom loved the sweatshirt as a Mother’s Day gift! The customer service was great! We were able to change some small color details of the flowers to my mom’s favorite color! The only thing is the sweatshirt isn’t super soft, but other than that, she loves it!
Shirts came out perfect. Seller was very helpful and made sure everything came out perfect and to my liking 👍🏻
The design was so beautiful and the hoodie great quality.
I got this for my sister for her birthday and she’s absolutely obsessed. The quality is amazing and it looks just like her cat. I highly recommend!
Great communication by the seller. The sweater arrived in great condition and was exactly what I ordered. My wife loved it! I highly recommend this seller!
We bought two of these!
I love it so much. I cannot wait to give it to my step mom!
Great item, great quality, mum loved it
The sweater is incredible! The embroidery quality is amazing and the thread colors are diverse to capture my dog’s fur colors and tones. The shipping was fast and even quicker than what Etsy suggested. This is a must-have gift for anybody who lost their fur baby or who simply wants to show their doggy pride.
-super good quality 
i love it i recommend her so much she’s so sweet!!
Great quality and design, and very good communication through
amazing quality - exactly like the photos & amazing customer service 10/10 would recommend & will be ordering again (i did 3 orders)
amazing quality - exactly like the photos & amazing customer service 10/10 would recommend & will be ordering again (i did 3 orders)
The sweaters turned out really well! They look great and are very comfortable.
Good quality, fast shipping, changes implemented
Amazing work! Can’t wait to give this as a gift. I know seller worked hard to make sure it arrived on time. Thank you so much!
I’ve ordered twice from this store (gifts both times) and both people have loved it! I ordered a dog one first, and have kept this store in mind for later purchases. The most recent was a sweatshirt with some my mother’s chickens since her favorite recently passed. The seller had great communication and worked with me through every step in order to capture the personalities of each chicken. I highly recommend this shop and will definitely purchase more.
The tshirt is a dream! I got it yesterday and am in love!!! Cant wait to hand over the present <3 Thank you
Amazing work! Looks just like my dog 😊
Great! Got it for Mother’s Day my mom loved it!
Absolutely love it! I got the shirt in memory of my dog and it turned out amazing!
so amazing. best gift ever
This is simply wonderful!! I truly reccommend. Perfect styling and the result is so similar to my little puppy, i love that!
I love it so much, thank you!
Item looked great and it arrived a lot quicker than  expected too! Seller was great and double checked before going forward with the final design, even went as far as following the little request to use a specific coloured line for the text. Overall great buying experience!
The sweatshirt and embroidery are very high quality. The design work was excellent and perfectly depicted our cats.  The customer service experience was great as well, highly recommend!
This is a great gift! Great quality and the outcome is adorable. The seller was very collaborative and understanding when rendering the design. They were a pleasure to work with and no complaints about the product. 5/5
The owner was understanding and I am quite pleased with how the sweatshirt turned out.
Beautiful job. My partner loved it and her sisters are going to buy from here!
Embroidery was lovely and customer service was amazing! Also fast service for a custom order and fast shipping to US America :)
I got a sweatshirt for my mom’s birthday and she loved it!
Amazing, they captured my dog so well!
Absolutely lovely, i bought this as a gift after our pet passed and it made our family cry it was so beautiful. They loved it!
I absolutely recommend. Only challenge was confirming sizing for the sweatshirt was hard as its not standard usa sizing (but this is a me problem!).
I love my pet sweatshirt!  The fabric is so soft!  The owner worked with me to get the coloring correct for my pet.  It's not a perfect picture of my dog, but it's pretty close!  Would buy again!
Great customer service :) :)
Mervat is amazing and she confirmed the final design before implementing
I'm very happy with the sweater! My dogs love it and it's exactly as described!
I am not satisfied with the quality of the product. I found the material of the hoodie thin and it did not fit well. The material had holes after 2 washes (especially where the embroidery is). I did not wash it on warm water and put the hoodie in a laundry net.
I then contacted the manufacturer, who was very accommodating. Even though I am not satisfied with the product, I am very satisfied with the customer service.
I love my sweatshirts! Seller works well with showing previews and double checking work. I got them following my youngest dog's passing. Thank you so much!!!
great quality and customer service! makes a really nice gift
Absolutely love this sweatshirt - have been wearing it all the time and showing it off to my family and friends! My animals were done beautifully and everything is very high quality. Seller was amazing with checking everything before solidifying the garment. Am definitely going to purchase again for one with my cat!
Beautiful and made such a special gift.  Quality of Artist’s work and the fabric were both outstanding!
Turned out so beautiful and exactly what I wanted!
Matched the mockup beautifully!! Highly recommend!
Extremely high quality and amazing communication!
I am so happy with how it turned out
The embroidery looks great and very well done
The sweatshirt I ordered came out perfect. The shop did a great job of turning my pet’s picture into an embroidery.
Super cute handmade item. Seller was quick to respond and very helpful! Would 100% recommend.
Bought for myself and a friend, great gift for remembering your dog
The hoodie was really beautiful and the shipping was faster than I expected. It’s a beautiful present for every animal owner.
everything was perfect, thanks :)
I absolutely love this sweater. I bought it for my mom who is obsessed with her new dog.
Beyond my expectations, looks amazing can’t wait to wear it.
My friend loved this gift. Wish shipping was a little quicker though
It was shipped pretty fast and exactly what I wanted. Thank you!
Just as the listing described
Very good sweatshirt! Good quality and the picture looked just like my dog
Awesome gift looked so much like my dog that has unfortunately no longer with us that it made my mum cry.
The communication was great. She double checked with me before completing my order! Will definitely be ordering from this shop again.
My boyfriend loved it! It's super cute and well made. Just make sure to order it early unlike I did because shipping takes a while.
Great present, so excited to gift again!
So good!! My friends absolutely loved their presents. Good quality garments and impeccable sewing with friendly service :) highly recommended!
As others have said Mervat was very prompt, and gave a preview of the design which was very helpful if anything needed to be changed :) Only very very small threads on the edges that i had to trim but otherwise it was perfect. My friend cried when she saw it!
A great product, the final product totally matched the digital rendering. Awesome price & a great gift!!
The seller was super responsive and met all of my needs.
This was great. We love it. 
Awesome customer service and it looks flawless. We cannot wait to give it to my mother in law for her bday!
I ordered two of these they both look fantastic turned out exactly how I wanted them the seller made them look just like my dogs so happy with this product would recommend
I love the design! The sweater is a little stiffer than I had pictured, but it is still comfy!
The process of making sure that the design was just right was extremely smooth and entire process was still fast. Will buy again in the future
Nice jumper, helpful communication from seller.
So beautifully done! Was a present for my mum as we lost our boy last year and  I just knew she would love this keep safe and to wear the jumper with him on. Made her cry! Thankyou so much for your lovely work x
My order was just as expected!! I would buy from Dream Lake again!
It turned out amazing, and it came in earlier than expected. It looks just like Maggie, and the seller was very kind.
My friend loved their gift!
The shipment was quick, and the customer service was excellent!
The seller was very helpful and provided a preview of the drawing. Once the item arrived it looked great and my best friend loved the gift of her recent dog passing. The quality of the crewneck was nice and soft. The shipping never updated but it did arrive on time of the ETA date. Highly recommend this seller.
The creator was very responsive and the sweatshirt came quickly and looked amazing.
Absolutely in love with the sweatshirt that I got!!
Great quality, beautiful design, excellent communication
My sister in law loved this product. The ship window was cutting it close for her birthday date. Messaged the seller and she expedited my order and we received it 4 days earlier than requested. Very kind and responsive seller. Thank you!
My daughter loved it, and the creator was very easy to work with to change the design
I gave it as a gift to my mother and she loves it.
It arrived way earlier than expected. The embroidery quality is great. The art is lovely and it really looked like my cat. It was a gift for my hubby for our 1st marriage anniversary and he loves it! Seller is also very accommodating and responsive. Thank you! Will definitely order again. 🥰
It is just as I had imagined it and I am looking forward to giving the sweaters away!
I think that when it comes to drawing the program, it lacks realism... although there are many identical breeds, each dog is unique. The customer service is great, they sent me the drawing that was going to be done and seeing it on the screen of the sweatshirt is like not seeing my dog. It was for my little daughter and she is delighted. I'm going to give them another chance because I want one for myself. But this time I need to see my dog in the drawing, not a dog of her breed, I need realism. And if I have to send 10 different photos and see 10 projects I will do it.
The sweatshirt seems to be of very good quality.
Thank you very much for reading me
I purchased this as a memorial gift and cannot recommend this item and shop more highly. The artist was patient and gracious with me in achieving the perfect coloring and look of my best boy, she was amenable to my requesting a custom wreath, my order arrived much quicker than anticipated, and the quality of my order is absolutely wonderful. I will cherish mine and bless the hands that crafted it.
Was perfect and very easy to work with seller — big thanks!
Really great sweatshirt with nice embroidery.
This is exactly what I was hoping for. Perfect gift for someone with a pet. The customer service was great!
Shirt is thick quality material and embroidery turned out amazing! The seller contacts you with drafts and then the final product. Great purchase!
Exactly what I wanted, can’t wait to gift it to my friend
Absolutely gorgeous embroidery! I’m happy to have my old girl on a hoodie!
Even when the product wasn’t what expected, this seller chose to take the time to make it right and correct it and it looks great! appreciate how kind and patient the seller was. Thank you for a sweater we’ll have for the rest of our lives!
This seller is amazing she takes her time to hand make her products and shows them to you to make sure you are happy before they are shipped. I ordered two hand made items we are thrilled with!
This item is everything that I would hope for. After losing my dog I feel like I can carry him with me every where . 
The level of communication I received through the process was exceptional.
Fantastic customer service and great quality!
so cute! i love it and it looks just like the picture :)
The seller worked with me to make sure it was as accurate as possible!
Top Seller! I recommend 100%
Beautiful quality! I would definitely recommend.
The customer service was excellent. They helped me a lot🩷
It is absolutly wonderful, i got it as a Birtday present for my Partner and im so excited to give it to him.
I loved making this personality and now it’s my favourite jumper. Something to take with me when I’m away from home
It is exactly what was shown! The quality is super nice and soft and the service was super nice and decently fast! And the packaging was so cute!! I love it so much I highly recommend, Thank you! 🐶🩷🩷🩷
Very great gift for any dog lover! Super cute! Embroidery was bigger than expected but still super pretty!
We’re so happy with our jumpers, they are the perfect way to remember our fur baby! 
Seller was quick to respond to messages and made the whole process simple for me because I really wanted them to be perfect! Great communication and we are so beyond happy with how they captured our lil man so well!
The sweater arrived as promised and it's beautiful!
The quality of both the fabric and the embroidery is very, very good and precise. I am really satisfied!!
Great gift idea. It is something really different and beautiful.
Freakin adorable. Love it. And the shirt is really thick and good quality!
Ughhh soooo adorable absolutely love it!
Everything exceeded expectations and the person who received the gift loves it!
Have recommended the sweatshirt to a few friends. The shipping from Australia to the US was shockingly fast.
Love it! Thank you so much!
Had one of these made up as a birthday present, using a picture of our black Labrador retriever. Turned out great and the unique gift was well appreciated and shown off to friends and family.
A great gift for any pet parent or those that have lost a pet. Highly recommend, the embroidery looks much better than a silk screen image.
Fantastic - looked exactly like the drawing! My mom loves it ❤️
The shop owner was so kind and accommodating as it was a bit difficult for me to get the picture of my friend’s dog for the gift! I really appreciated that a draft of the design is sent first just to make sure!
Mervat created the most beautiful piece to honor my mom's "soul dog." When my mom opened her gift, she immediately burst into tears because of how realistic it is! 
I can't speak highly enough on the quality of the piece. You can clearly see how much time, effort, and care went into creating the sweatshirt. 
When I placed my order, Mervat was quick to respond and catered to my ideas on the design I had in mind. Once I was sent the initial design, I wanted to alter one of Snazzy's ears, and Mervat immediately sent back the alterd design. 
My mom is already begging for more sweatshirts in every color. I will 100% order from Mervat again. Overall, the customer experience is top-notch. I wouldn't hesitate to order from Mervat. They create the most amazing pieces!
Such beautiful work! Customer service was top notch as well
Absolutely love it, great quality
I love the sweatshirt so much! They perfectly captured my pups face.
Ordered this to be sent straight to my sister for her birthday. She absolutely loves it. The artist captured her pup perfectly- first go.
This gift was so good and it came out perfect!!
Thanks you I love it
This was truly a pleasant surprise when it arrived❤️My pets look identical to their pictures and the seller service is very punctual and makes sure that things are done right before the final look. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
It came out super cute!
It was beautiful, my girlfriend really enjoyed it.
Wonderful and well knitted, it met my expectations.
Very good service and very good quality
I never received my package. This was for a friend’s birthday and it was a one month plus wait time. I waited to eventually just get a message saying package received. But I never got it. Tried to ask the seller for help and she just confirmed she got the right address and that I need to check with the delivery guys. Really??  That’s all the help? I still have not heard any outcome from the delivery investigation and that’s just like a substantial amount of MONEY WASTED on this. I would not recommend this place.
This sweatshirt is amazing quality & the seller was easy to communicate with!
Arrived so much faster than anticipated, great quality and such an easy and efficient customer service. The embroidery turned out perfect. All around great experience, would recommend 10 out of 10 times!
I just received my order in the mail today and it was perfect. It is a gift for my mother in law and she absolutely loves it.
The sizing runs quite large, but otherwise very happy with it!
Great quality and service! Also came very fast!
The quality of the item was amazing. It turned out way better than I expected. The seller was really nice great customer service. She was very helpful and the shirt turned out so good and I mean so good I can’t even put it into words I would highly suggest the seller if you’re wanting to get one for yourself or for a gift, shipping was super fast and the item was packaged very well!
Bought as a birthday gift for my sister. It turned out amazing and she loved it!
Hoodie with my dog Izzy turned out beautiful. Looked just like the picture I sent. Was a gift for my sister. She absolutely loved it.
It came how I ordered.
Great customer service and such attention to detail!
Came out perfect, bought it for my mums birthday she loves it
If your a dog person, I would absolutely recommend this item. Although I was a bit worried, it is a product that delivers both quality and satisfaction. The designer gave constant feedback and incorporated my itty bitty requests, and even allowed me to send my own design to be incorporated into the final design. I think a lot of people might be concerned if they can achieve the final design they want, but don’t worry, from my experience they will help you with the design and coloring all the way through. Beyond that, the quality and delivery was spot on, something you would expect at this price range. 10000% recommend this item. I am not glazing this seller, I was really satisfied by their work; it was an amazing gift for my partner on their birthday.
So cute I love it and it looks just like my dog! The seller was so great and communicated so well!
I am obsessed with the sweatshirt I received. The rendering looked exactly like my dog and I am so happy!
Great quality and represents my dog perfectly.
This hand made sweatshirt exceeded our expectations in every way! Customer service is truly top notch and I am going to purchase another one!
I ordered this for my best friends for her fur babies and she absolutely loved it! I enjoyed working with the seller, I love that she was able to work with me and show me proofs of the design and was happy to make changes when needed! Great service!
This is everything I hoped for and more! It was a birthday gift for my fiancé. He loves his dogs so much and this was a great way to have them with him anytime he wears it! One has recently passed and the seller created something that will be cherished for a long time❤️If you're on the fence about ordering this product, I HIGHLY recommend it!
I got this for my best friend and she absolutely loved the sweater. The seller was very helpful throughout the process.
Seller kept in touch through each step of her craft. Excellent craftsmanship
The quality of the design is so well done!!!! the sweater itself is also very nice and soft! My partner loved the gift and is excited to show off her fur babies!! 10/10 would recommend and will be placing a new order for my sisters soon!!!
Very good design looks exactly like my pet
Perfect, personalized gift.  Highly recommend.
Beautiful!  Fabulous Birthday gifts for  dog loving family members. Will definitely get more.
Marva was very attentive and handled all my needs with kindness - and most importantly the sweatshirt is just a dream come true! Not kidding! 
Take into consideration that it takes time to create and ship the product so plan your gifts ahead
I was excited to get the sweatshirt! It was beautiful!
So cute! Second time ordering one and it’s again perfect.
Asked for a review of the product before it shipped out (wanted to make sure I like the picture I picked). They were so helpful every step of the day and I love my new sweatshirt ❤️🐶
The sweater arrived earlier than expected and turned out beautifully. They were open with communication and allowed me to approve the design before the product was made and shipped. Highly recommend
Very nice rendering of our dog’s photos. Looks great on the sweatshirt and my friend was super happy with it!
It was perfect and they were so responsive :-)
Got them as a gift for family and they loved them. Amazing quality and quick shipping

Absolutely amazing gift - arrived quickly and exceeded expectations
The sweater is so comfy and the design is super cute. I got a mockup of the embroidery, asked for a slight adjustment, and had a quick response and update!
Great costumer service. Quick response time and over all very cute item!
My friends dog passed away this year and this present was such a special gift. Verbatim from my friend: 
‘It's such thoughtful way to remember her. Like I can't thank you enough. Probs one of the best presents I've ever received., 
The seller took the time communicate and recommend the best photo to render and I appreciate the seller’s expertise. Quality is beautiful and the pink is so pretty!!
Amazing gift! It looks better than the pic i sent in!
Keep in mind that seller is from Australia ( i believe) so shipping could take a while depending where you are.
Beautiful work.Thank you so much I miss her so much. Just
love it
Love the sweater! Great quality, communication and customer service! Thank you!
Seller was extremely helpful and responsive. The sweatshirt came out perfectly! Definitely exactly how I had imagined and made a wonderful gift :)
Excellent product and customer response time was quick.
The product I received was better than I’d hoped. Truly captured the image of my pup!
Hi, This turned out great.  The package was delivered in less time than advertised, in time for my son's birthday.  The likeness to his dog is outstanding.
The cutest jumper ever, really good quality.
The sweatshirt came out perfectly! It looks just like my friend's cat!
The picture literally does not do this shirt justice. It is made SO well. No loose seams. I can’t wait to give it to my bestie for her birthday. Shipping was so fast!! Would HIGHLY reccommend purchasing :^)
Great item very well made
Absolutely beautiful! Got this as a gift for my sister, but will definitely be ordering one for me as well :) the pet detail is perfect.
She was able to capture our dog perfectly! It's absolutely beautiful, and I'll be getting more in the future.
The fabric and embroidery are such good quality. Comfortable to wear as well. It's so cute, and I got so many compliments!🥰
Our order was wonderfully done!
The quality of the sweatshirt was great. The embroidery captured the likeness of the photo sent.
This sweatshirt was exactly what I wanted ! Got the portrait of my rabbit and my dog. I will cherish it!
Super cute! Looks like my little Bruno- shoutout to the buyer who got her bunny Goose! Great late Valentine’s Day gift to me and my boyfriend!
This sweatshirt is great! Looks just like our dog!
Great product! Would order again!
Wonderful quality! The embroidery looks just like my dog.
Great quality sweater with beautiful embroidered picture of my fur baby. My husband loves our dog and he loved this gift. Highly recommend!
Turned out amazing! 
Got it for my mother and she loved it!
Perfection. My friend loved it!
The quality of the stitching was top notch. The sweatshirt runs very small so we ended up needing to get 3 different sizes. However, customer service was exceptional and they worked with us to make it right.
I love this! It is perfect and looks just like the pictures I sent. This seller is amazing and very easy to work with. Highly recommend. The sweater itself is also very comfortable. Thank you so much!
I got this as a gift for my husband whose childhood dog passed away recently. He absolutely loved it! I did have a special request to add a halo which was an additional price but the seller was so kind and was available quickly. She worked with me and sent me her design for confirmation. They did a wonderful job on this. I cannot recommend this enough. Thank you for creating this beautiful piece of memorabilia for us. We’re eternally grateful
The sweater came out perfect. I got it as a birthday/valentine’s gift for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved it. I asked the artist for our deceased BMD Lola. It looks just like her photo and we couldn’t be happier. We will definitely be ordering more in the future! 💕
The item came out really well, I was a bit nervous, it seems like some dog colours are a bit harder to do but with a black brown and white coloured dog it came out great
Designs are cute and the embroidery skills matches it, and the cotton t-shirts are nice thick quality!
A perfect resemblance to the picture, the embroidery was well crafted.
LOVE how mine turned out
great hoodie I love it
Got this as a gift for my mom. She loved it! Thank you 🙏
My wife loved her customized sweatshirt!  The proof got sent quickly for confirmation,  and the finished product looks just like it!
Owner was extremely responsive and helpful throughout the designing, processing, and shopping experience. Proofs were sent, and the product I received was a spitting image. Highly recommend!!
the sweater is really great
Artist was really responsive and sent proofs of the design beforehand, which was nice to see before the final product was made. My brother loved it as a gift
It turned out great!!! It was a gift for my sister and she was absolutely obsessed with it. I feel like her dog's essence is pretty hard to capture but they nailed it! I was super impressed with how well it turned out.
Item matched the image I sent her so well. I couldn’t be more excited about it.
Amazing help with getting my wife’s dog image just right. Beautiful and well made. Thank you!
Customer service was great to work with for the proof. love the sweater
She is with you the whole step of the way! Making sure you are happy with the outcome and the picture you choose.
Love the sweatshirt, it’s exactly what I was hoping for!
Exactly what I was hoping for! Excellent quality
The name was very crooked under my pups picture but I still wear it and appreciate the sweater so much!
Absolutely gorgeous! I’ve gotten so many compliments! My cat just passed away so I’m grateful to have something to remember her always
The sweater quality is stretchy, which is good, however it would be nice is the inside was a little softer. The embroidery was ON POINT!!! My husband absolutely loved his.
The item was high quality and looked really good! The seller was quick in getting a mock up image to me and it looked great the first time. She even took more than one image into consideration to get the cat looking just right.
Great service! Made a great gift!
I loved the quality of the crewneck and the color was beautiful! Then, the design of the dog surprised me, it’s neat and not small at all. My friend loved the gift!
Really beautiful work. And great fabric quality. Also very nice contact.
They were very quick and helpful coming up with the design. It’s great quality and was true to size!
The Customer service was excellent.
The item is well made and corresponds to the rendering! and super cute embroidery!
I ordered TAN and received BROWN. Took several chat exchanges (and screen shots and proof of my order details) before seller finally admitted their mistake. Was asked to re-submit photo, which I did. Same photo. Now seller is saying it's not high-res. It's been almost a month since I placed the order - and it's a gift. Seller is using delaying tactics. BUYER BEWARE.
Absolutely loved the final product! Seller made sure to send a rendering of the design before production and worked well making sure the best results with the photo I provided.
Great communication with the seller. Very fast shipping and most important of all the sweater is amazing! Im sure my girlfriend will love her present!
Good quality and nice colors
Nice quality fabric and the stitched image turned out perfectly!
Awesome quality! Was very responsive
Shipping took a lot longer than expected. Shipper sent me proofs which I liked however the final came out a little different. Grey was used in the ears and nose instead of brown like in the proofs. The dog has no Grey on the body or in the picture not sure why grey was used as it was not sent to me that way in the proofs. Kind of disappointing
Sweater was beautiful and details of the design were beautiful.
Good item, the position of the image was however a little too far over on the side of the chest to look right.
came out great. will definitely order more.
Turned out amazing, very good quality and very communicative
Cute sweater! 
My friend loved it 😊
My daughter loved seeing her pup on her beige sweatshirt depicted exactly like the photo she provided me.  Be patient with the vendor if you live in the U.S. becaus they will give you proofs to review and there is time for production and time for shipping.  It took longer than anticipated (though ordered at Christmastime was undoubtedly a challenge for the vendor).  The finished creation was so lovely and thrilled my daughter.
Embroidery is on point! Highly recommend!
Absolutely stunning! Very well made and soft! Highly recommend
Love the sweaters I ordered and they got here super fast! 🤗
Mervat was amazing! She kept me updated on every step of the process and sent me pictures to ask for my approval for everything. Shipping was fast and the quality is amazing.
Looks great! Just like the picture
We love it ❤️ It's just like the picture and the embroidery gives a long lasting impression.
The embroidery itself is great, clear, and clean. Was sent a pic of what the image would be before item was shipped, and it wasn’t fully what I envisioned. Did ask if there could be changes made, and seller was SO kind and really listened to what I wanted! Could not be more thankful or pleased! LOVE my sweatshirt so much!!! The sweater isn’t plush on the inside which would have been nice but, still a comfortable and good quality sweatshirt!
It is perfect! So happy with my order.
my sweater is sooo cute and comfortable and whenever i wear it out people always ask me where i bought it!
The embroidery on this shirt is absolutely stunning. Highly recommend for pet parents!
Great quality and the saleswoman helped a lot.
Super great, really perfect.
Item got lost on the way to being delivered but the seller was very helpful in getting it fixed.
OBSESSED!!!😍  This sweater is perfect and captured the dogs so well. I loved the mock up she did of my dogs I had that printed and framed for my office too.
Now my husband wants a matching one 😂
Perfect! Thank you so much!
Perfect! Thank you so much!
Perfect! Thank you so much!
I ordered this hoodie with my mom's dogs embroidered on it, and it came out beautifully! She absolutely loved it, and the embroidery looked JUST like the photos I sent for reference.
So cute! My wife loved it. The embroidery looked just like our dog.
Can’t really ask for more, item was exactly what I wanted. Great detail and customer service was rapid helpful.
Got this as a gift for a friend and it turned out so well!!! Will be ordering again for myself
Love the product, great quality and genuinely a good experience.
Quality of the sweatshirt could be better
The sweatshirt I ordered turned out beautifully
It came out adorable! Love it!
The item was just as described, and the communication between myself and the shop owner was effortless. Only issue was delayed shipping; however, extremely happy with the purchase!
Absolutely incredible. The sweatshirt was stunning and paid homage to the sweetest girl. It looked amazing. I cannot brag on this shop enough. Will absolutely be back
Great communication and great product!
Lovely! Absolutely wonderful. My mother loved it, almost made her cry she was so happy. I got her little senior yorkie (Tootsie) on it with our newer pup (Lola).
Fabulous Item!  Thank you
Absolutely love love love this sweatshirt!!!
I just love it ! Very good quality.
Absolutely amazing!! Beautiful sweatshirt with perfect embroidery - such an awesome gift. Thank you! 👌
Beautiful portrait that looks just like my fur baby! My guy is black and white, so the black had to be substituted with brown - which makes sense but was a surprise upon receiving it. Adding his name to the wrist cuff is such a cute little detail! I'll be wearing this sweatshirt all the time.
The name was spelled wrong also didn't help that it took forever for a mis spell and said it was my fault
Quality was amazing, they were so sweet and helpful and really made  a great product that was really important in my life. Couldn’t be happier!
Amazing quality and even better service! The pets are spot on and seller communicated with me before shipping! Highly recommend!
It was absolutely beautiful, my mother loved it and the seller was so lovely to work with❤️
The sweatshirt was super cute - looked exactly like my dog. Shipping takes FOREVER tho so just beware but overall v satisfied with my purchase
Exceeded my expectations! It’s so darn cute! I want to wear it all the time. Great quality as well!
shipping took foreverrr, and the quality of the sweatshirt is mid. it’s not fuzzy inside and it’s a little bigger than expected. the embroidery is really well done and adorable, but it isn’t as close to my picture as i’d hoped. it’s all good though! i would still recommend this product to friends and family. the seller was pretty responsive and helpful as well.
It looked amazing!! Thank you!
Looked exactly like Hank. My sister loved it.
Quality was great! And item looked exactly as it was advertised! Will have to order from them again!
My step mom loved it
I ordered a sweatshirt and had my Australian Shepherd embroidered on it. I sent her a photo, she sent me a photo and after I asked to critique it she was more than happy to and was very quick to respond, then sent me the final edit and it was perfect! When the sweatshirt arrived, sooner than the anticipated delivery date, I opened it and it was in  very nice packaging. I saw my Aussie embroidered and it brought me to tears because it looks JUST like her! The florals surrounding her face in the embroidering just made it even more special. I will be ordering from her again, I would recommend her to anyone! Hands down the best embroidered item I have ever owned!
The quality of the item is great. Wonderful material. Gave 4 stars because the model given before had some decently significant changes in color to the real product. The picture on the sweatshirt is still obviously my cat though so it was good. And considering this product has a much more reasonable price than most custom pet products it came out incredibly well. The shipping was really quick for having to go from AU->US. The seller is also very kind and prompt with their responses. Great product would 100% recommend.
Great quality, the embroidery was so cute! Quick response & rectification of shipping issue
I love the embroidery, the shop owner did a great job matching it to the picture, it looks just like my rabbit.
Good quality.  The embroidery is great!
The seller was extremely quick with responding and sends you the picture before it is put on the sweater! The sweater came out exactly how I wanted!
A wonderful product and perfect gift!
A wonderful gift to give. Purchased two of these and both recipients loved them! Quality was wonderful and all interactions and requests were handled courteously. Would certainly recommend!
The sweatshirt looked wonderful. Just like the pups.
The embroidery was literally perfect and looked just like picture. I just gave 4 stars because the inside of the sweatshirt isn’t that comfortable. Not a typically cozy sweatshirt material
My father liked it very much
Great sweater and was a beautiful design
It took a while before the sweater could even be shipped. Otherwise everything went smoothly and the result was great 😍
Very satisfied with this purchase
Great product!! Would absolutely recommend
Quick shipment and very kind and helpful
Item was great quality and fit was accurate
The Hoodie is really sweet. Thanks a lot <3
The seller was amazing and sweet! I wanted my order to be special for a good friend and they delivered! My friend loves it, I highly recommend!!
I bought one for my GF with her dog, and she absolutely loved it. It came out perfect. 👌
My daughter loves her shirt.  You have truly captured the essence of our dog --- the embroidered pup looks slightly concerned just like he always does.
My sister was breath taken by this custom embroidered sweater! I got this for her since our dog passed away. She was her best friend, her everything and this design is identical to her. My sister cried when she opened it up, and couldn’t believe her eyes at how incredibly beautiful it is! She did an absolute phenomenal job on this custom order, with the flowers exactly like the ones in the picture and the shading is just perfect! Truly amazed at how it turned out! She even let me see the design before the embroidering, and I was astonished at how much it looks like our Raleigh! 11/10 reccomend!
Great jumper, pleased with the imagery! Thank you
Great product would definitely recommend
Great sweatshirt. Got as a gift for my wife. Cannot wait to give it to her.
Amazing product would buy from again!
The sweatshirt was beautifully crafted. You can tell time and care was placed into it. The seller worked with me to make sure that I was satisfied before going into embroidery production. Thank you so much! This is such a beautiful way to commemorate my beloved cat. Highly recommend! 🤍☺️
Nice embroidery, very close to the sample sent by the seller. Managed to make the black cat look good. Just the S sized shirt is more like an L size though..
Great quality and fast delivery
if you need to ship anywhere in the world add all the charges to the initial order.  Otherwise its an issue when the item arrives asking for some additional shipping charges .  please xworks is the shipping method
ordered as a surprise for my wife right after loosing our dog to cancer. she absolutely loves it!
The quality and craftsmanship on the embroidery was amazing. Better than I expected. Highly recommend.
Beautifully done, was a great gift.
My sweater came out absolutely perfect. I always get compliments on it and have gotten a couple of my friends and coworkers to order one!
It turned out amazing. I hope my sister likes it
:) :) :) :) :)
My sister-in-law almost cried when she opened this! Truly amazing
This was a gift and came out perfectly! Love the detail!
Very cute and Mervat was extremely nice!
Great quality and the embroidery was exactly like the picture she made. Got it as a Christmas gift it was perfect. Make sure you just order in advance if from the US.
Shipping took a while due to the holidays, but the seller was kind and kept me updated on delays and updates on my orders! My family loved the sweaters and they were amazing quality! Would recommend!
Great quality and wonderful customer service
The sweatshirts are amazing! After writing back and forth with prompt and sincere responses, we came up with the perfect mock up of my friends dog and he looks absolutely perfect. Thank you!
The person who received this sweater liked it!
Very good quality, exactly what I asked for. The discussions were pleasant and the delivery time correct, given the work to be done. 
Thank you !
Great quality and she captured Brady beautifully. Thank you!
amazing quality!! such a great gift
the quality is amazing, the customer service was awesome & they were super responsive with me needing some things changed with the sweatshirt! it’s better than i imagined
My dog resembled exactly the same in the jumper. Very nice and efficient present 🎁
My wife loved her gift, would recommend!
Was very responsive and sent proofs of the image before starting the embroidery.
got this for my mom and she absolutely loves it!!
The costumer service was amazing! The seller worked with me to make the product exactly like the photo, and it turned out great. The sweatshirt quality is perfect, and the embroidering is very neat and sturdy. I ordered during Christmas season, so naturally it took longer than expected, but the product was so worth the wait. The seller sent the original draw up, and I asked them to  make an edit which they did right away. Overall a great product! I bought it as a gift for my mom and she loved it. I’d say the sweatshirts are true to size and great quality. Would definitely recommend!
So happy with this order! The sweatshirt was a great quality and the stitching was amazing. It was exactly as described and the seller is amazing!
My sister loved her gift! Her dog has a little spot on his nose and she even got that little detail
This is perfect! I got one for myself and my husband and they came out exactly as I hoped. Customer service was responsive and the embroidery is excellent quality. I want to wear mine every day!!
I am completely satisfied with this article, it is magnificent. I will now be able to have my little angel with me all the time🕊. Thank you so much !
The sweatshirt is very cute! However, the final product was much darker than the rendering. The colors were also not the same as in the rendering. And the seller was out of stock of the color sweatshirt I ordered.
The sweater is comfortable but it is smaller/tighter than anticipated. I am happy with the purchase though. 
It took so long to receive this item. I would recommend ordering this item months in advance.
The quality was fine, but when I received the shirt, the name on the sleeve was backwards. I contacted the seller she said she could do a partial refund, I said I would like it replaced but she gave me the refund and it was only a $7 refund, I understand it was probably just for the material used but the whole shirt was ruined and I paid $75. It was a Christmas present for my mom, and she was very upset about the name. It definitely did not meet my expectations. I will not be buying anything from her again.
Doesn't look much like my cat Chester but I am the one who approved the rough draft so that's on me. But over all this item is wonderful. The sweater feels like 100% cotton so no fuzzy inside that sheds. Its super warm and the embroidery is strong and well done. 5/5. Just don't be like me. Speak up if there's something you'd like to see changed.
Our dog passed away a year ago and each of us has something to remember her by except my sister so when I saw this I thought it would be perfect for her and it absolutely met my expectations. Gucci’s essence has been captured which was exactly what I wanted, I’m so grateful for this gift and I will definitely be getting myself one!
Looks great and came when it said it would
Oh my gosh! thèse two sweatshirts that i ordered could not be more perfect. the seller was so amazing with contacting me & even changing a size. i will absolutely be ordering again!!! they’re amazing quality & turned out beautiful.
Beautiful item, gave it as a gift. Picture was spot on!
Ordered this for my mother in Japan. She shipped this for me to Japan and she always sends proof for you to confirm. I’ve ordered several from her and everything comes out great.
Seller was very nice and great to work with! Sweatshirt turned out great!
Even better than I expected! If you’re ordering outside of Australia, it’s worth the wait of shipping! The artist checked in with me to make sure the digital rendition of my pet was good (it was perfect) before stitching it. The design is also larger than expected and so so so so beautiful
Amazing quality and fast shipping
Great product the quality is exactly what we wanted!!
Super cute and colors came as expected. I requested the embroidered item to be on the right side of the sweatshirt but it was placed on the left side. I wish the name of the pet was a little bit bigger but it was a gift and the receiver liked it.
So beautiful, good quality! I love it !
Took a very long time to come but great quality!
The seller was very accommodating and kept me up to date while preparing my order. My best friend loved her sweatshirt. The embroidery looked so much like bootsi . I’m happy I chose this person to do the work. She truly hit the nail on the head with her work.
Second time ordering from Mervat after my sister in law loved her sweatshirt and her husband requested one too! Amazing quality of the embroidery—looks just like her pets photo
Great product and communication. My partner loved it! Would buy again
Turned out perfectly ordered from them twice now both great
Quality of sweater was great and the embroidery was amazing as well. Shipping took way longer than expected but it was during the holiday season. Order way in advance just in case!
Item was going to take longer than expected and the seller reached out to ensure that was okay. I said yes, and waited, it was worth the wait! The item is precious, I know my sister-in-law will love it!
It's excellent quality. The embroidery on the jumper was in amazing detail and so spot on from just 1 image of each dog. I sent a message before ordering, and I received fast and helpful replies. Received updated shipping information when there was a delay and a rendering to make sure that the illustration was okay. Very professional. Thank you. The jumper was perfect ❤️❤️❤️
Very cute! Got it for a friend and she absolutely loves it!!
LOVE THIS, so professionally done:)
I had a sweatshirt made for my daughter in law. The embroidery of the dogs was very detailed. I loved it and so did she!
Terrible customer service, never received item and would not refund or replace.
Order way before needed. Takes a while for shipping (2 months). But worth it! Good quality and portrait is perfect!
Sweatshirt came out exactly how I was expecting. Great quality!
Amazing product! I was blown away by how accurate it was! My sister loves her gift
Solid quality. Received exactly what ordered.
Communication with the artist was perfect. She let me know that due to her high number or orders, that my order would be coming after Christmas. She let me know this well in advance to Christmas and even asked if I would want to cancel it and try someone else. I told her I was fine with it coming afterwards. She was very easy to contact and the item came in and was perfect. I couldn't have asked for a better seller/artist.
This made a great gift
Came out super cute! Quick responses in term of design questions.
Seller responded to messages super fast and exceeded my expectations. This was a Christmas gift for my best friend and she loved it !!
Looked amazing and loved the sweater material. Sends a proof for approval.
Absolutely perfect likeness to my cat! The embroidery is very good quality and the sweater feels very nice and warm. I’m so happy with my purchase
It was great! Beautiful work <3
Amazing quality. Excellent communication! 10/10
The design was absolutely perfect, the sweater was not as soft as imagined but otherwise a solid purchase.
It looks absolutely fantastic, the seller contacted me throughout for any necessary modifications or what she thought would work better. Turned out amazing! Great job for my two babies in heaven ❤️
Great item my wife loved it
Beautiful embroidery - customer service and sweater was awesome.
Sweater turned out great for a Christmas gift! Only downfall to ordering, seller got swamped with holiday season. Heard from seller 2 weeks after purchase letting us know it would not make it in time for Christmas, by then it was too late to order through another seller to receive in time. Did not receive shipping info until the item was delivered. Overall great quality, just order in advance if you are looking into it.
This turned out amazing, the embroidery is absolutely beautiful and matches the picture I sent her perfectly! Such an incredible talent and lovely woman, very easy to work with. Thank you! ❤️
The best thing I’ve ever received from Etsy was this shirt. I got it for a gift and it came out so well I have to get one for myself.
So cute! I got this as a gift for my sister as our dog passed away and it exceeded expectations!
Seller demonstrates effective communication. Additionally, the stitching left me in shock. I am overjoyed to own a piece of clothing that depicts my dog’s physical and emotional attributes. I am thankful I will be able to forever cherish this piece for years to come. Myself and my family loved how well it showcases Poppy. Poppy makes everyday brighter; for she is the embodiment of sunshine, and the seller really showcased that.
Very high quality item, with very beautiful relief. My beloved girlfriend!
Same as previous. Just regret buying two products from her. Never again
Amazing! The image was so realistic! I'm in love as is the individual who I gave it too :)
I am so happy with the it and it looks exact to the picture I sent :)
The design came out great and the seller was really good with communicating!
Sweatshirt turned out really great but beware, shipping took over a month and a half! We placed our order in October and received item right before Christmas. Seller was responsive but took a few days to response to messages and I had to constantly ask for updates. She sent me a proof and  willing to edit it until my liking. Sometimes this process took a while. Since it took over a month I was not going to be in my original place for shipping and seller was able to update shipping address. Overall really like the sweatshirt but took a very long time to receive.
I ordered this as a gift and it was worth every penny. The quality of the sweater is great. our dog was all black so the extra time put into bringing out his features meant a lot to me. My father in law is looking forward to getting his own!
I loved the personalization of this sweatshirt! It was perfect for Christmas
Really loved the sweatshirt! Thank you!
Great customer service and product
Very beautiful finished product! The image on the hoodie looked just like my sweet boy. Highly recommend this shop. 😊
Just absolutely chuffed with the outcome! Love it. Made for a tear filled gift.
This sweatshirt was adorable and of good quality!
Exactly what I ordered! Got it for my mom as a chrsitmas gift she loved it. GREAT communication with seller.
Item was well worth the wait just make sure you are paitent and order far in advance
The item is very cool! I got it as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it!
The seller was wonderful. My order wasn’t ready due to the amount of orders she received before Christmas so she offered me the chance to cancel the order. Instead, I requested a proof of the item so that I could give that for the Christmas present. I received the item a few days after Christmas and it is absolutely perfect. It captured the personality of the dog in the portrait and it was so well done. I’m considering buying another of the same!
Got these sweatshirts as wedding presents and the bride and groom LOVE them, have been wearing them a ton.
Great communication and she helped me pick the color and style that would best fit the picture! Can’t recommend her enough!
Update: the seller re-embroidered a new sweatshirt and shipped it to us and it was much closer to the rendering. My boyfriend loved it. I am glad she made it right with this order. 
I ordered a sweater with my boyfriend’s dog embroidered on the chest as his Christmas gift. I picked this shop because the delivery date would be in late November/early December. Unfortunately, weeks after the order was placed i was informed delivery date would be after Christmas. I went with it anyways because I already placed the order. The owner was very communicative about the digital rendering and I was very pleased with the design we finally agreed on. Unfortunately again, when the item arrived,  the actual embroidery was far off from the rendering and we couldn’t even recognize our dog. We are very disappointed and won’t order from them again.
The most wonderful gift!! Our oldest cat is nearing the end of his life and I gifted my husband this sweatshirt and he absolutely loved it!!
The embroidery turned out better than I could have imagined!
The Product is just perfect. I love my dog very much and searched for an item to have him always by my side. It looks just like him. Thank you!
A really nice sweater in good quality. The embroidery is beautifully done. Unfortunately it is brighter than expected.
I ordered this item 6 weeks before Christmas (the Etsy notes on her page stated it would arrive by 12/23). Her notes also state she has a turnaround time of 1-3 days after ordering. After following up numerous times, I was told *two weeks* after placing the order that it wouldn’t arrive by Christmas. At that time, I had not even gotten a rendering. Since there was already a delay, I requested that she expedite the shipping, and she said she would; however, it took 7 business days for my package to arrive after it was shipped. Communication was awful and it was lie after lie with this seller. During the time she claimed she was too busy to fulfill current orders, she added a 20% discount for future orders instead of making things right with her current customers. I will never purchase again from this seller.
After 3 revisions, still could not get it right. I am not sure why the thread could not be done in brown, because this looks absolutely nothing like my parents deceased dog. Truth be told, I was too ashamed to give this item as a gift, as it felt insulting to do so. Super let down, considering the photos and reviews looked amazing. See photo attached to reflect my criticism.
Seller tweaked the design until I was happy. Very responsive and helpful. Shipping was fast.
10/10 fantastic I would love to buy another soon and I recommend very highly
My husband was very happy with his sweatshirt ☺️
The communication was amazing, a little late on the delivery but what do you expect during the holidays, great gift would def get another one
The sweatshirt smelled of cigarette smoke which was pretty gross but other than that, the embroidery looks great. My niece loved it!
Amazing quality! Exceeded expectations! Customer service was amazing! Will be ordering again, the perfect custom gift!
I ordered two items (sweatshirt and a hoodie) with the same image for my husband and I and they turned out perfect! The seller was so sweet throughout the process and I really appreciated that the image was sent over for confirmation before it was completed. Thank you so much! ❤️
The sweatshirt was so cute
Due to the holidays, my order was running late. Seller was honest that it would not arrive in time for Christmas, but I was worth the wait!
Super cute and great customer service!
Amazing amazing quality. Customer service was amazing owner of shop was very responsive and really listened to what I asked for. She was amazing!!!
Sweatshirt and seller exceeded our expectations! This was the sweetest gift and tears were she’d Christmas morning upon reveal! Captured the personality of our pup perfectly, will be a keepsake for years to come. Sweatshirt is very comfy and high quality too. The embroidery detail is just next level in person. Can’t recommend enough! Worth the wait!
My roommate loved it! Very cute!
Very nice item. I got a sweatshirt for my mawmaw for Christmas and she absolutely adored it. I’m very thankful.
My mother loved it!  Looks just like her dog.
Amazing quality! The seller was great to work with about getting correct colors of your pet!
Great quality of the pet image.
item matched all description and was exceptional but the delivery date was pushed back multiple times. came a few weeks late
This was a perfect gift for Christmas it was very well made and the seller was very kind and responsive
This is one of the best purchases I have made. Quality is great! Only doing one less star because I did order this in mid November and the shipping date said Dec 1-3. When December 3rd rolled around I reached out as no updates had been given and the shipping date was changed to January 1-3rd. This was a Christmas present and I intentionally ordered really early to give the creator time. 
She did work really hard and got this to me before Christmas which I am so grateful for! But it was stressful none the less. Anyway my husband is a Vet student and if his classmates ask I will totally send them this way because the art, quality, and overall product are amazing. If you order for Christmas order before I did to save yourself some heartache
The sweatshirt is really cute!
The hoodie itself isn’t too bad, not as soft as first imagined - but still okay. The design matched the rendering provided by the colours were a little off. Had a bit of trouble with delivery - being a month later than expected but wasn’t communicated to me until I reached out wondering where my item was. The seller was nice throughout the process though.
This sweatshirt turned out better than expected! Customer service was great! We had some confusion about the delivery date. They replied fast and worked overtime to finish the product. I really appreciated it- especially this time of year when things are crazy and there are more orders than usual. 100% recommend:) Will order again in the future!
long delicery time, but very cool product
Great sweater my girl loves it
Most stunning hoodie ever! Quality is great. 
Seller is also very patient and shows their design before making. 
Couldn’t be happier to gift this
Such an amazing product! The seller was prompt in communicating with me and being transparent and was very accommodating. I was a bit nervous at first as the shipping was a far distance but it all worked out perfectly and arrived in time!! Would definitely recommend and purchase again
Seller very nice and worked with us to get the perfect picture. Very communicative! I highly recommend!
This product is absolutely amazing! I truly am over the moon with how well it turned out and my best friend is IN LOVE!
Absolutely beautiful!! The stitching looks exactly like the dog I requested!!
the picture turned out amazing, quality so good, and they were so helpful about the picture
Loved how it turned out. Great seller! Would definitely buy again
Wonderful customer service. Loved how it turned out. Just what I wanted. Definitely recommend this seller
Great customer service and I like the quality of the fabric.
It turned out literally so perfect! Best gift I’ve given
Updating my review after the seller messaged me with a solution to my problem. They want everyone to be satisfied with their purchase and will make sure it happens! They redid the sweater with the colors we agreed on and it looks much better :) happy with the result and the customer service 😊
Took longer than expected to ship, so the gift is late, but it's great quality and I think my SIL is going to absolutely love it!
So perfect! The sweatshirt turned out exactly like I wanted. I highly recommend!
Absolutely stunning work and great quality—could not recommend enough!!! Will definitely come back 🤎
This seller was amazingly sweet and understanding throughout this entire process (even when i was being super picky haha)! She was sure to promptly answer any questions I had along the way. 
The design was a bit smaller than i had expected when it came but that was due to me not reading the dimensions. The quality of the crewneck was great and the design was absolutely precious. Better than i could have imagined. 
I bought this for a friend who lost her pup last month and she ADORED IT. 
I cannot recommend this seller enough. Will definitely buy again if i’m looking for something similar in the future.
I ordered a sweatshirt for my sister for Christmas with her adored dog and best friend, Peanut, embroidered on it.  I ordered it in plenty of time before Christmas, and delivery was estimated 2 weeks before.  Then there was a delay due to the Christmas rush.  The owner, Mervat, informed me of this and estimated delivery after Christmas.  I was very disappointed and let her know the importance of having it before Christmas.  She was understanding but explained she had voluminous orders.  She said she'd do her best, and that she did!  She shipped it in time and I received it on the 19th.  The embroidery was impeccable and the likeness to the photo I sent was great!  I would highly recommend DreamLakeStudioAU and Mervat!
This lady was very easy to work with….and the shirt was beautiful! My granddaughter will love it ❤️
item turned out so good
embroidery was just as i hoped!
embroidery was just as i hoped!
Item is nice, the embroidery are well done and accurate compared to the picture sent. Not the best quality but decent.
It took a very long time to receive it and despite the company being registered in Australia, it's made in China as per the delivery tracker.
Great quality and amazing work
Great quality and really loved it
This sweater is so cute! My sister is going to love it. I was very picky about the photo rendering, but she was so sweet.
Love the sweatshirt. It’s super soft and the cats on it are way bigger than I expected which is wonderful. Took awhile to get to me but thats to be expected when you order something from another country during the holidays. Can’t wait to give it to my sister!
good quality love it so much
Excellent product and friendly service, would recommend.
Shipping took longer than expected, but product was great. Would order again.
It turned out wonderfully! My daughter is going to love this special gift! Thank you!
Love this sweater! Excellent customer service, thank you for working with me on this order. I really appreciate everything you did to get it here in time. 10/10 highly recommend! Thank you :)
Great communication and quick responses. The sweatshirt looked just like how it was pictured. Make sure you read the description and shipping was later than what Etsy chooses
It's a difficult task to get something that looks decent of an all black dog, but this store did a great job at giving some definition to my mom's dog!
Really good customer service! Shipping took a little longer than I would’ve liked but everything worked out perfectly
The seller worked with me
Amazing quality embroidery, looks just like my two cats! Took a little longer than expected to arrive but my husband loves it!
Absolutely loved the item! Very well done
Was an awesome jumper. Loved it!  Thanks!!
The sweatshirt turned out exactly as I hoped!! ❤️
Absolutely adorable and feels amazing!!! Looks exactly like my sisters pets!!!
Got this as a gift for my GF's birthday. She loved it almost as much as she loves her cat (that's a lot).
The seller was wonderful and the sweatshirt came out amazing! The person who I gave the sweatshirt to loved it!!
Nice, friendly contact with the seller, great design!
Very good quality. Only the agreement regarding the motif took a long time
One of my hoodies was wrong, seller fixed issue by sending me a new one
The item is great quality. Shipping took a little longer than expected and when the sweatshirt got to me it was not what I had ordered. I informed the seller of the mishap and they remade the sweatshirt, PERFECTLY, and got it to me in great time!
Amazing product, quick responses. Was able to ship in time for Christmas!
Product was great, we loved it
The finished product turned out beautiful
The finished product turned out beautiful
It looks exactly like the picture
Quality looks great and item met my expectations!
Great quality and shipping was fast!
just exactly what I expected! the seller was very nice and responded fast if I had any questions. came out just what I expected. the hoodie material isn’t what I expected but after I wash it, shouldn’t be a big deal, but overall absolutely worth the money
A gift for a friend of mine and she absolutely loved it!
Hood quality, accurate representation of my pet, good customer service
Great product!
My granddaughter will ❤️ it
Shipping took longer than expected, but the embroidery is exactly like the photo and she helped to get the order shipped in time.
Love this that I got when I had to move away from my girl ❤️
Shipping took longer than expected, but otherwise was great
Looks so good super happy with the design :)
Got it for a gift and she loved it! High quality
Item arrived later than expected
Amazing! The seller was so sweet and easy to communicate with!
I got the wrong size, but other than that, everything looks great!!
Absolutely amazing!! I am so excited to give it to my friend!! Can’t wait to order another one
I love this sweatshirt so much!  The embroidery of my boy turned out even better than I expected and I’m so happy with it!
Looks exactly as the picture I sent. High quality and great cotton fabric. Perfect for a slightly chilly day.
The item did not meet expectations. The art and the actual embroidery look different. And the color matching is not right. Doesn’t look like the pet when executed in embroidery compared to the rendering.
Absolutely love what I received. Such great quality and the stitching is perfect. The perfect gift !
It's exactly what I ordered and is perfect.
The quality and craftsmanship is outstanding! The sweatshirt is a nice mid-weight top, and the embroidery is perfection. The process for reviewing, editing and approving the design was a breeze. Would highly recommend!
Greta product. Came very late but I understand business.
One of the best Etsy purchases I have ever made!  The hoodie quality is superior. But more importantly, the essence  of my four dogs was captured magnificently in the finished embroidery product. Great communication with seller too. Everything is perfect!  I’ll be back to this shop for sure!
Just as expected…definitely captured my dogs eyes!!
Very responsive and helpful seller. It may have been the picture I chose, but the stitching was just slightly off. Overall, an amazing gift!
It took longer than expected, but it’s a custom item. And came from a different country, so it’s pretty fair. Quality is amazing!
This sweatshirt turned out so cute; I love it!
Originally my purchase didn’t meet my expectations, but the seller offered to remake it for me - now I’m happy!
The sweater looks so great!!!!!
Amazing, good quality nice designs
Really awesome service and shirt!
Absolutely adorable! The design same out so perfectly and I could imagine a better Christmas gift.
This sweatshirt came out so cute! My mom loved it. It is her new favorite sweater!
Absolutely beautiful!! The quality is amazing and communication with the seller was very easy.
Beautiful! My friend loved it!
I love love love my hoody thank you so much
She was very sweet and helpful!
The quality of the hoodie and sweatshirt are nice, but I expected them to be a bit thicker.
There will be a delay or communication will take a good amount of time to make sure you got the right design
Love it and communication was easy
this is for a friend, for christmas and i’m sure she will love it! other than it taking a bit longer than it needed to for shipping it’s perfect :)
The sweater isn’t as thick as I had hoped & the colours of the embroidery don’t match the draft version which is a bit disappointing - my girlfriends puppy is black & grey, but the embroidery that I received was light brown :( There is also a number of loose threads
I would’ve like some differentiation between the puppy’s head & its ears, but hopefully she likes it anyway!
Mervat was good to communicate with, but it did take over a month from when I placed the order, to when I received it!
Update: New shirt received and it is still messed up. My dog is now orange and the seller did not send me a photo before sending me the product as promised. I’m completely over this and very disappointed.
The quality is completely different to what the seller showed me and told me would be embroidered. It looks nothing like my dog and looks nothing like the preview image. The colors are completely off and I am not happy having spent $93 just to wait a month for an item that I don’t even want to wear.
The sweatshirt was made exactly as I requested! It had beautiful detail and made the perfect gift.
Absolutely love this jumper, very personal and really gorgeous
This is a lovely gift that I cant wait to give to my husband. I went for a personalised embroidery of our dog on the chest of a jumper with his name on the sleeve, the process was easy as I sent photos and a sample image was sent back to me. DreamLakeStudioAU were amazing as I asked for a slight change to be made to make the embroidery look more like our dogs features and they made this change with no issues and a sent new sample with the correction through quickly - thank you so much, I love it!
So cute! Great quality sweatshirt & the embroidery is amazing!
Beautiful work on the sweatshirts
the quality is so good! i got it for my sister's birthday and it arrived in time! it turned out so good and looked just like her dog :)
I love the Sweater so much!
Lovely sweatshirt. It's comfy and the custom embroidery is perfect. I'm super happy to have it and I'm even thinking about getting a similar t-shirt.
The product came out better than expected!
Looks soooo cute, and so comfortable.
This was such a well designed, high quality item! My sister just got a puppy this year, so it made for a great Christmas present. The quality of this item did not disappoint!
It looks amazing!  They did such a great job
Amazing service. 
Very prompt responses and redid the design for me ( just a little touch up) so gratefully appreciate the work. 
Really cool store
Will buy again
The item was exactly what I wanted! There was a snag in delivery when I messaged the seller she said she didn’t have our sweatshirt color in stock; arrived much later than expected. But I would order again because of how cute they were!
SO cute and worth it!! Came out so perfect I had to order my husband one
These make the sweetest gift for the pet lover in your life. Very high quality!
Although it was hard at times to keep in contact with the seller (only because of the time differences), the sweater is divine. Super soft & the embroidery is top notch 👌🏼 thank u so much!
Item matches description very well
The work that goes into this sweaters is amazing ! The embroidery work is just amazing, it looks exactly like the picture I sent ! My only two small complaints would be the sweater isn’t really warm at all it’s more like a lightweight sweater and the “O” and “D” look exactly the same in the writing but with a different font that wouldn’t be an issue at all.
Other than those two small details the work is amazing and the shop provides excellent customer service! Will for sure shop here again !
This seller answered all my crazy questions and created an amazing sweater for my daughter. Fast responses, fast shipping (all the way from AU to the US) and a high quality product!
Absolutely Great Quality!!! My mother loved it!
The package took longer to be shipped and delivered than originally estimated, but the end product is so great that I don't mind! The best quality crewneck and stitching out of any option I've seen on Etsy. 10/10 recommend!

Colors were off compared to the ones sent in the example and the sweatshirt itself is pretty then. It took about a month for it to come so make sure to order in advance to make sure you get your item in time.
I loved it and would recommend
This crewneck came out absolutely perfect!! It’s a gift but I love it so much I might order myself one! The communication between the seller and I was also fantastic. She kept me up to date with my order and showed me previews. Highly recommend shopping with them!
Really nice quality and the seller was very kind
The seller was really understanding and able/willing to edit the portrait sketch when asked :)
It was perfect. My wife absolutely loved the sweater with her dog on it. Thank you so much!
Update: The seller sent a new sweater and it is so much better than the first. It came in quick time too. I really appreciate the customer service. 
The seller was responsive and great at adjusting the digital image they had created of my pet. But the product I received looked nothing like the image. It has random colors splashed all over the place, and some spots weren’t even covered with thread so you can see the sweater through the pattern. On top of that, the colors selected for the digital image were not the same as what was on the sweater. I was so excited to see the final product but unfortunately it doesnt look like my pet. I dont think Ill be wearing the sweater.
The sweatshirt is beautiful and looks just like our pup! Seller was incredibly helpful and patient as she worked with me to get the design just right. 100% would order again. Amazing gift!
Absolutely stunning. It fits beautifully
This sweatshirt turned out beautifully. My mom is going to love it!
I ordered 2 Sweatshirts and they turned out so beautiful! I love them and would definitely recommend them!🥰
I ordered 2 Sweatshirts and they turned out so beautiful! I love them and would definitely recommend them!🥰
The quality of the item is really good the mock up of the design is slightly different to the design missed out the colour of the eyes
The product is great, I love it!
The sweater I received looks good! There was a small mistake and the seller fixed it right away. I recommend this shop!
Absolutely loved the quality and everything about it. Please open up again so I can order more.
UPDATE: After my initial negative experience, the seller contacted me and asked if they could remake the sweatshirt for me. They prioritized the order, and were able to get a new version to me relatively quickly. The new version matches the proof much more closely and the names are corrected. I am grateful for the positive customer service.
The item came almost 2 weeks after it was originally supposed to arrive. The colors and design did not match the proof that was sent, and even after I specifically confirmed that the dogs’ names were on the sleeves corresponding with their faces, they were still put on the wrong arms. This is so disappointing, especially for an item that took over a month to get to me and cost a lot of money.
Super cute it looks good on me
Very cute sweater!! The seller was incredibly responsive and did a great job turning the photo into a picture of our cat. Lots of color options for the sweater and I liked the embroidery designs a lot too. The sweatshirt is nice and comfy but it isn't one of those ULTRA SOFT sweatshirts. I don't have a problem wearing it but I was hoping it would be slightly softer, although I get that would probably make things more expensive too. Overall would definitely recommend it for pet lovers.
Exceeded expectations! The shirt came back exactly as the print that was sent for approval.
Great customer service, despite being a little bit expensive, I highly recommend!
Love the sweater is cute
I LOVE the sweatshirt I received. However, it took well over a month to get the sweatshirt. For the money spent, I expected better shipping. I won’t order from this seller again most likely, because of how long it took to receive the item (that was given as a gift). If shipping had not been such an issue I definitely would.
it looks amazing, doesn’t feel cheap or easily damaged. the seller was very flexible and good communication! thank you so much!!!
Bbbhhnnjkkkmnbhh Bhutan ban jjjj hjj
THE WORST EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD! 
the owner gave me the worst customer service ever.
the draw took 3 weeks, not a few days as says, while every few days i asked about it as it was a birthday gift and couldn't delay long after the shipment deadline.
but after it was already sent, and already been in my country the seller ignored the delivery company that they dont have my cell information and couldnt reach me for the delivery, SHE MESSAGE ME AFTER THE ITEM WAS ALREADY SENT BACK!!! after that when there is only a week from my friend birthday, i ask her to not wait for it as it will take too long but to make a new one and ship it overnight, WHICH SHE IGNORE COMPLETELY and rarely answer any questions i had about options.
in the end a two month planning went down the drain as this is the worst customer services i ever had
Nice sweater, looks great and detailed!
Great quality and amazing design! Captured the souls of our past and present buddies. 💙
there was some missed lines in the embroidery but it still ended up being very cute!
Beautiful work, the seller was very kind and responded quickly.
My sweatshirt is super cute and looks just like my cat! It took a little longer than stated for me to get the initial design but after that, the artist had revisions done quickly and it shipped soon after the final design was done. Artist was very helpful with revisions and making sure the design was just right.
Easy and efficient, product looks like illustration sent
Took longer than expected to ship, but quality is great. Looks amazing.
i got an xlarge for an oversized look and it wasn’t as big as i expected but it’s still definitely oversized. The art is amazing and I appreciate it so much and the color is beautiful.
The design was nice, the sweatshirt it’s self was somewhat oversized with sleeves that were quite short.
Great embroidery on the sweater with a really clear image
Beautiful! She absolutely loved it
My mom absolutely loved it. Came just in time for her birthday
Seller is very easy to communicate with and was accommodating for all of my requests. I love the final product, it’s perfect for Christmas!
Sweatshirt was a gift and they loved it. True to size, comfortable, and the design is beautiful.
It turned out amazing!! I gifted it to a friend of mine to remember her dog, and she loves it. The quality was really good, for both the design and sweater itself. The shop owner was very gracious and worked with me before I even purchased it. She messaged me with a mock-up of the design to make sure it looked good, and I really appreciated that!! I will say the shipping took a while (a little over a month) but I understand why, especially since I’m in California USA! Just make sure to order ahead of time for birthdays, Christmas, etc!! Overall I was so impressed, my friend loves it so much. Definitely 5 stars!
Embroidery was fantastic, and the design came out great! The crew neck itself was average in quality and a the fabric a little uncomfortable but still a great purchase. The seller was very prompt in replying to messages and was helpful.
The sweater is absolutely beautiful and good quality. Communication with the seller was a little weird at first, but in the end it was exactly what I envisioned/wanted for the picture. Thank you!
The embroidery is amazing quality and looks just like my dog and the mock-up. I wish the sweatshirt was better quality as the material isn’t very cozy. If you’re in the US be careful on sizing as it ran small so while I thought I ordered a roomy size it’s quite snug. Probably my mistake for not looking at the sizing guide for measurements if there is one.
Great product and service! Will order from this vendor again
great product, very good quality
Quality of the item, Great if you want to wait 2months. Product ship date continued to be pushed back over and over again from estimated ship date so if it’s a gift don’t plan on it arriving anytime close to the initial estimated ship date. I was messaged 2weeks later after order was placed and told the color choice I picked was out of stock and to pick another- when I responded that I’d just like a refund all of a sudden my color was in stock. Supposedly item was made and then shipped but no shipping information was ever given or updated on Etsy, product was mysteriously lost and another had to be made after a month of waiting? I’d be very weary to order from this company.
The actual sweatshirt is great quality and the embroidery is okay, though messy, but the customer service and attention to detail was lacking. I originally placed my order on 9/13 and had to go back and forth for almost two months (received 11/6) just to get the color and drawing right. I felt like she was rushed and not fully reading the messages so she kept missing things and generally seemed like she didn’t have time. After two months, we got the picture right and I approved it. When I received the sweatshirt I opened it up only to find that the color was wrong and there was no name on the sleeve like I had requested. When I mentioned this to her, she just immediately gave me my money back with no offer to fix. I’m very disappointed with the amount of time I had to put in to this and after all that the result still being wron
Very beautiful embroidery! Nothing to say at this level
On the other hand, the sweater seems to be of fairly poor quality and is not very beautiful once worn, nor very thick (I expected better given the price)
The main thing is that the embroidery is beautiful
Got this as a gift for a friend and she absolutely loved it! She said it looks just like her dog Harry!
Timely responses and great design!! Highly recommend!
I was so excited to get this sweatshirt for my boyfriend with our two dogs on it! The customization was incredible considering my dogs are very multicolored. I want one for myself now!!
beautiful quality! definitely ordering again!! ❤️❤️❤️
I bought one for my mom for her birthday and it was absolutely perfect!!! They were able to not only make our dog (Bob Waffles) so adorable, but they also captured his personality as well.
I got the custom pet hoodie for my partners bday and she absolutely loved it. Their first time seeing it was my first time seeing it as well and I was very excited and very pleased with how it turned out. I do recommend to order the item a month+ if you need it for a certain date. Besides shipping being a little later than expected everything was wonderful especially their customer service.
Comes wrapped beautifully and on time. Item feel great and design was beautiful. Dealing with retailer was seamless. Would purchase again and recommend :)
Highly recommend. Seller provided wonderful service and beautiful end product. She sent a rendering of the images prior to embroidering sweater. She was patient, professional and meticulous with the design. This level of attention to detail is always appreciated when it comes to personalized items. Thank you!
It looks so lovely! Can't wait to give it to my friend
High quality embroidery and soft sweatshirt, was a gift and they loved it.
Great sweatshirts, amazing for the holidays as gifts
Beautifully made! So happy with how it turned out!
The quality is nice, definitely matches description, and met my expectations great for a dog parent gift !
Look’s just like my Luna :) thank you so much for the amazing work my mom and me love the sweatshirt very much ❤️
Jumper has arrived and looks amazing! Thank you so much.
It’s PERFECT. I couldn’t have asked for anything better.
Speedy delivery and great quality.
I just recently lost my cat and I came across this page because I really wanted something beautiful to remember him by that I could have forever! I couldn’t be more happier with this product it brought tears to my eyes it looks exactly like my boy❤️
Amazing quality product, definitely beat my expectations
I am super satisfied and happy with the sweater.!!
Really great sweater! Good quality and the picture looks super similar to the pet!
The sweatshirt is good, and the craftsmanship of the embroidery is great; however, the ears on the illustration were wrong. After a few exchanges, I made the edit myself to show what color the ears should be (brown, not pink or peach) and after confirming the color was now correct, the ears on the actual shirt are pink. 
Again, it’s a lovely product overall. I’m a little disappointed that after getting it right via messages, the ears still came out wrong on the shirt.
I asked to see the design before it was put onto the sweatshirt. It looked fine after multiple edits. Then when it arrived, it looks way different with messy threads. Gray around eyes was suppose to be black or close to black and is gray on final product. Has a whole gray thread going half across her face. And has messy tan threads above her head. Name was agreed to be a Lilac color, was white when it arrived in mail.
Beautiful design & great communication
The wait was so worth it! It turned out perfect. I've only worn it a day and have gotten so many compliments!
The sweater I bought is a gift for my mom and I know she’s going to love it!! The design is beautiful and looks exactly like the photo I sent of my dog! The seller also sent a photo of the design to make sure I was happy with it before continuing which I really appreciated! So happy with it!
The shirt I received was really beautifully done. It will make a for perfect birthday gift! The seller responded to all of my questions promptly. The shipment was delayed so I would advise buyers to plan accordingly, but when the seller was informed of the date I needed it by they made it happen. I really appreciate the effort there!
Great quality and amazing present
I got this for a friend who lost 2 of her furbabies. We all loved the quality, and the embroidery really looked like the dogs. The timeframe for delivery is delayed compared to what the estimated time of arrival of the listing was, but if you expect it, no problem. The sweatshirt was well worth the wait. Just keep in mind to order enough weeks in advance and shop on!
Quality is excellent and looks just like my dog!
Beautiful work!! I highly recommend! ❤️
This was a gift for my mother and she ADORES it! It turned out perfectly and the seller was kind enough to ship it quicker than the initial ETA so my mom would have her gift closer to her birthday. I highly recommend this shop and this item!!
This was a gift for my friend and she absolutely loved it! It's very well made with good quality clothing. The creator sends an initial design for approval and was very patient with me wanting to make a few changes. Highly recommend!!
Amazing sweatshirt !! The designer made sure to send me a proof of the design before finalizing the product. I am so happy with my purchase. My mom wears her sweatshirt at least once a week! 
The image on the sweatshirt matched the images I sent exactly!!
Great quality sweatshirt (100% cotton) and perfect custom embroidery.
I Love it so much!
The sweatshirt was perfect and I loved it- but I didn’t get the chance to wear it. Be warned the sweatshirt will shrink 3 sizes smaller if you dry it! I didn’t think of it, but I threw it in the dryer and it shrunk so much it is now unwearable. The customer service was great and the design was very well done- just make sure to hang dry!
Had an issue with the item but the owner replaced it immediately very happy
So cute. I got it as a gift for my sister and she loved it
Item came out just as I pictured it would. Good quality as well.
Beautiful sweater made with a lot of love!
Product was great. Interaction with seller was good, she was always prompt in replying. Only issue was timeframe completely blew out. Ordered in mid August and at the time of ordering the ETA was around 2 weeks ish, didn’t get the product until the beginning of October. No real updates given unless requested and no explanation. Happy with product though.
I ordered this for my sister’s birthday and while her cat doesn’t have a ton of distinctive features it looks just like him! Thoroughly impressed
I boight two, and they were both amazing
everything was beautiful. The dogs looked amazing on the shirt
My package was stolen so cannot give a proper review
Sweatshirt looks amazing! Love it
Absolutely lovely. Wonderful quality sweater and the embroidery is beautiful
Sweater was perfect. Receiving the rendering was very helpful
Seller was very helpful and it came out so cute.
10 out of 10!!! Highly recommend as a gift for the pet lovers in your family.
Very well made and accurate to my pets!
Amazing quality and exactly what I had envisioned! Mervat was incredibly communicative and helpful, even making a last minute adjustment to my order. The sweatshirts arrived much faster than I anticipated as well. I'll be making another order soon! Such a perfect gift!
Wonderful product!
Absolutely incredible and looks just like a photo!
Beautiful quality and great shop experience! We purchased a custom pet embroidered sweatshirt as a gift and were very pleased with the quality of the shirt, as well as the detail of the embroidery. The shop owner was very easy to communicate with and made the whole process feel seamless and easy. Five stars, will be a returning customer!
Love this business and their products. Will always buy from them
Turned our really great! The picture was so cute
I love my sweater! My fur babies look perfect. Thank you!
came in perfect condition!
Beautiful and looked just as pictured in the posting!
Great quality, embroidery was detailed, jumper was thick!
Looks great- looks exactly like the reference photo
Phenomenal work done by a phenomenal artist! I wanted two done for myself and my partner and not only are they spot on to the reference I sent, but both are identical to each other. I wish I would’ve taken a better picture of them side by side but I was too excited to take many pictures.
I love my hoodie it looks like my Nalah! Thank you.
Absolutely perfect! Seller worked with me to ensure it was exactly what I needed!! I ordered a second one for someone else due to how wonderful of an experience I had shopping with this vendor!
The sweater and quality was great. My mom absolutely loved it. Shipping did take longer than expected so it was a little frustrating but other than that, the item was amazing. Would buy again.
Fantastic! Easy to deal with and such a talent!
Was very disappointed in the customer service in this shop. Product was great once it finally arrived. I ordered this material seller confirmed my order then shut down shop for a week i reached out while shop was closed to make sure my order was being processed. Once shop was back open she informed me the color I originally ordered 2+ weeks prior was out of stock. Then had to change my sweatshirt color then she proceeded to let me know my sweatshirt would then ship out after my original date material was supposed to be shipped. So almost a month later and later for the reason I ordered happy with the sweatshirt but would not order from seller again due to bad communication.
Super satisfied and the sweater looks so beautiful
Amazing seller! Bought as a present for a friend and she loved it. Good quality.
Took a little longer to receive than expected. Just wish the inside of the sweater was softer. But otherwise very happy.
Shipping took a little longer than expected, ordered on July 13, received August 21. But quality and design looked good!
It’s perfect! My little sister is going to love this gift for her birthday!
Amazing quality and service, fast response and making sure it is what I needed.
So cute!!! Came out amazing. Present for my mom, she loved it! Will definitely be purchasing another in the future
Beautiful! Well made and really high quality!!! Thank you so so so much! 🩷
Amazing
10/10 exactly what I was hoping for!
everything was perfect!!!
Just to make a change and shop owner very nice about changing.
Beautifully stitched!  The fabric of the sweater is very soft and comfortable.  The design was also bigger than I thought (a very good thing!). Love it.
Super cute!! Looks just like their dog!
Simply outstanding!
What a cute sweater will be a great gift 🥰. Customer service was great too. Since there were no more hoodies, I got a normal sweater. The rest of the money was transferred to me without any problems👍
Seller made sure they had the best pictures and sent me renderings before hand to approve!
My sweatshirt came out great! The seller was so receptive to working with me to tweak the design in order to make sure it came out perfect. It shipped very quickly after giving her the final approval of the design. Highly recommend this shop and would definitely purchase again
looks awesome. Totally nailed the picture I sent
Super cute - perfect present for my dad who loves his dog!
Amazing Detail very good Quality
Everything about my sweatshirt/crew neck was flawless! I LOVE it so much and the embroidery is a replica of what my dog looked like. Thanks so much!!
Great quality - my pup looks so cute! Thanks so much!! Would highly recommend!
The embroidery was beautiful and high quality but the sweatshirt itself is low quality. The sweater say 100% Otton in mine not cotton and it does not feel even close to cotton. You’d assume it is a misspelling but the material is a strange cheap polyester. The seller was helpful and had great customer service.
This sweatshirt is very nice and comfy. I wore it to the airport and received a few compliments! Seller was very nice and helped me with my order.
Bought for myself and my mother. Our girl passed two months ago and we both teared up when we opened the package. It’s a beautiful way to keep her by our heart and in our memories.
The sweatshirts turned out exactly how we wanted! Mervat was super reachable and communicated with us throughout the whole process. Would definitely order again.
Loved it, thx u sm!!
Amazing sweatshirt for my roommate and her cat! The whole process was great through the picture to sketch phase to the shipping! Thank you for making an adorable crewneck :3
My husband loves it!! Prob the best bday present ever!
The sweater itself is rather thin and I wish the inside was softer, but the embroidery itself is exactly as pictured in the sample photo sent to me. It also took much longer to receive my order than anticipated
My shirt is so precious! I even asked if they could add a special symbol that’s meaningful to my dog and it looks beautiful! I love the execution. Thank you!
The seller was great, very communicative and accommodating to my specific custom needs. The sweaters were also nice quality, with embroidery very detailed and precise. Would highly recommend

The seller was super accommodating to make sure I got exactly what I wanted!  I love my cat sweater!  The quality is amazing!  Would definitely order again!  Can’t wait to show off my new sweater!
Gorgeous! Came in decent timing and so cute :)
I received the second order I placed of my two dogs on the sweatshirt they are so darn cute…. Looks just like them!! The seller does such an amazing job!!! Definitely would recommend, thanks!
Beautiful! The picture of my dog was sewn on with so much love! A one of a kind piece! I already love the sweater! Thank you very much!
This was such a wonderful gift for my partner’s birthday. The fabric of the crewneck itself is a little rough, but the embroidery is beautiful! She followed my instructions to a tee. A great, thoughtful gift—and it looks just like the cat!
Absolutely in love! Better than I could have anticipated.
thank you for my sweater!! <3
When I received my order l, there was an issue with one of my dogs and the thread color that was used. After speaking with Mervat, she was kind enough to remake my hoodie and was so understanding about the whole situation. Thank you again, my mother is so happy with her hoodie. 💙🐾 phenomenal customer service and amazing product quality.
Great quality and looks amazing. Highly recommend!
Absolutely love the jumper! Looks exactly how I wanted it 🥰
GREAT quality!
Such a beautiful design and great quality hoodie. I will be ordering again. Love this business!
I am amazed!! This was so well done and better than I can imagine, I get so many compliments on my sweet puppies face on my sweatshirt and it was done much quicker than I thought too!
Beautiful, high quality work from Mervat! My sister in law loved it as a bridal shower gift, and her husband now wants one too! Received the item two weeks earlier than expected. I didn’t receive a design proof to review beforehand, but the result was amazing, so I don’t think it was necessary after all. Considering purchasing another of our family dog as a gift for my sister.
Thank you so much for the adorable sweatshirt!! My daughter absolutely luvs it and the embroidery work is beautiful looks just like her dog!!
I ordered another one for her husband, super cute!!
Thank you!
I absolutely LOVE this sweater! it so comfortable and i get compliments from people all of the time. Right after i ordered this sweater for my first dog, we adopted a puppy. Once she has stopped growing I will for sure be ordering another one!
Such a beautiful sweater with great quality and I can tell it was made with love
Absolutely LOVE my shirt. It is PERFECT 🩷
Quality is so good and looks exactly like the picture sent! Very fast shipping as well ❤️
